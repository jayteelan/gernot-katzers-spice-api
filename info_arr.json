  "used-plant-part": "Leaves; frequently, the entire herb (all aerial parts) is harvested. Best harvesting season is before flowering. Basil leaves should always be used fresh, as they lose most of their flavour within a few weeks after drying. However, in the Georgian spice mixture khmeli-suneli [ხმელი-სუნელი], dried basil is employed (see blue fenugreek).  The seeds of basil have some use as thickening agent in Thailand. In their outmost layer, they contain mucous substance that, on absorbing water, developes into a thick slime surface with an intriguing, opalescent blueish hue. While these basil seeds lack any taste or fragrance of their own, they contribute an interesting texture, both soft and (by value of the core) crunchy. They are often employed in liquid sweets or sweet drinks.          Mexican spice basil flower  ",

  "sensory-qual­ity": "Fresh basil leaves have a strong and character­istic aroma, not comparable to any other spice, although there is a hint of cloves trace­able.  In addition to the Medi­terra­nean type most common in the West, there is a plethora of other varieties or cultivars with different flavour, many of which are hybrids.  India has its Sacred Basil (O. sanctum = O. tenui­florum) with intensive, somewhat pungent smell; in Thailand, there is another sweet basil with a great licorice aroma (see also cicely). Varieties sold to gardeners in the West include cinnamon basil, camphor basil, anise basil and Mexican spice basil; the latter has a very pleasant, complex and warm flavour, with a wonderful sweet note more reminiscent to cinnamon than to anise; I have found basil of this type sold fresh on Georgian markets, to be used as a garnish.           African Blue Basil           African Blue Basil (O. kilimandscharicum × O. basilicum)   A last group of culti­vars is charac­terized by citrus odour: Thai lemon basil (O. citri­odorum) has a distinct balm-like flavour, and then there are lime basil and another lemon basil (O. ameri­canum) which has an ex­tra­or­di­nari­ly pure and fresh lemon aroma (see also lemon myrtle on lemon fragrance in general).  Perennial basil species from Africa (Ocimum kilimandschari­cum) and Asia (Ocimum canum) have recently been intro­duced to the Euro­pean herb and gar­dening market. These species has a strong, but less pleasant flavour; hybrids between them and Medi­terranean basil are a recent in­novation, with novel appear­ance and flavour, and enjoy growing popu­larity.  In English language, the com­mon basil grown in Italy and other Medi­terranean countries is often termed sweet basil; this is, though, mis­leading, because Thai basil has much more of a sweet quality. Thus, I will avoid this term and speak of Medi­terranean type and Thai type instead.          Flowers of Indian Sacred Basil   All basil va­rieties have in common that their dried leaves are much less aromatic than fresh ones;  deep-freezing the herb is the best method of pre­servation.          African Blue Basil (O. kilimandscharicum × O. basilicum)   Main constitu­ents The essential oil (less than 1%) is of complex and variable com­position. Within the species, several dif­ferent chemical races exist, and further­more climate, soil and time of harvest influence not only the amount but also the composition of the essential oil. The most important aroma components are 1,8 cineol, linalool, citral, methyl chavicol (estragole), eugenol and methyl cinnamate, although not necessarily in this order; typically, one or two of those dominate the oil, but hardly any basil contains all of these com­pounds in significant amounts. African species often contain camphor. Some species are characterized by compounds outside of the mentioned spectrum, e. g. thymol.             Flowers of Indian Sacred Basil            Indian Sacred Basil (tulasi [तुलसी])            Wild form of Indian Sacred Basil            Flowers of Indian Sacred Basil   Further mono­terpenes (ocimene, geraniol, camphor), sesqui­terpenes (bisabolene, caryo­phyllene) and phenyl­propanoids (methyl eugenol) can be present in varying amounts and strongly influence the flavour. There is con­siderable infra- and intra­specific vari­ation, opening favourable per­spectives for future plant breeding by selection. Prospects are enhanced by the fact that basil species hybridize easily.            Indian Sacred Basil (tulasi [तुलसी])            Wild form of Indian Sacred Basil    The quality tra­ded in Europe, Western Asia and North America (Medi­terra­nean type, also known as French or Euro­pean Basil) is charac­terized by 1,8 cineol and linalool, plus smaller amounts of estragole and eugenol. This de­scription holds also for both green-leaved and red-leaved (antho­cyanin con­taining) strains. Eastern Euro­pean cultivars contain slightly more eugenol.          Sacred Thai Basil (kaprao [กะเพรา])   Indian Sacred Basil (O.  sanctum = O.  tenui­florum, called tulsi [तुलसी] in Hindi) owes its stronger, somewhat pungent taste to a sesqui­terpenoid, β-caryo­phyllene, and a phenyl­propanoid, methyl eugenol (both around 30%) plus minor amounts of methyl­chavicol (10%). The Sacred Basil of Thailand (ka prao) was found to also contain β-caryophyllene besides a phenyl­propanoid, eugenol and a sesquiterpene, β-elemene. Chemotypes centering on eugenol alone are rare; their odour closely resembles cloves or allspice (see below about O.  gratissimum).           Sacred Thai Basil (kaprao [กะเพรา])           Sacred Thai Basil flower           Sweet Thai basil (horapha [โหระพา])   A couple of chemo­types are domi­nated by estragol (methyl chavicol); these stand apart by their sweet anise or licorice fragrance (anise basil, sweet Thai basil). Also in this group belongs the New Guinea basil, an attrac­tive per­ennial plant with red leaves and an inten­sive fra­grance; its botan­ical affili­ations are unclear.          Sacred Thai Basil flower   Lemon‑scented varieties (Ocimum americanum, O. citri­odorum) contain mostly citral, a mixture of the two mono­terpenoid aldehydes neral and geranial.  The African species, O. kili­mandschari­cum (often known as camphor basil), is characterized by much camphor besides 1,8 cineol; camphor is also found, albeit in lesser quantities, in kili­mandschari­cum hybrids with O. basilicum (e. g., African Blue).          Tree basil (O. gratissimum)   Lastly, cinnamon basil owes its scent to a chemical also found in cin­namon and cassia, methyl cin­namate. A most pleasantly scented cultivar called Mexican spice basil was found to contain methyl cin­namate, β-bisa­bolene, 1,8 cineol and estragole. Litera­ture de­scribed both cultivars as be­longing to the species O. basilicum, and I strongly suspect they are synonymous.           Tree basil (O. gratissimum)           Flowers of the East Indian  Tree Basil (O. gratissimum)           Flower of East Indian Tree basil   The wild species Ocimum gratis­simum (East Indian tree basil, also known as clove basil), growing in tropical Africa and Asia, appears to have a very complex chemism of its own. At least six chemo­types are known, named after their impact respctive com­pounds: eugenol, thymol, citral, ethyl cin­namate, geraniol and linalool. The most common variety sold to Euro­pean gardeners is very rich in eugenol, but contains also some thymol that makes for an attractive spicy, pungent flavour. Culinarily, this plant is generally underrated.           Flower of East Indian Tree basil   This collection demonstrates clearly that basil has a remark­ably vari­able secon­dary meta­bolism, as is often found in the mint family: Perilla and mints show a similar genetic di­versi­ty.  For several related herbs like thyme, oregano and sage the com­position of the essential oil is known to depend on climate, soil, genetic strain and season.           Flower of East Indian Tree basil           Wild growing East Indian tree basil (Sri Lanka)   The dark red foliage of some basil varieties is caused by pig­ments of antho­cyanin type, which are com­monly found in reddish leaves. In wild species, red-leaved specimen are quite rare; but this strain can be easily selected and en­hanced by breeding. For the formation of deep red leaves, intensive sun­light is re­quired in any case; if given maxi­mum sun­shine, red-leaved basil varieties may contain up to 200 ppm antho­cyanins in their fresh leaves.

Wild basil found in South India            Lemon-scented Indian wild basil            Wild growing East Indian tree basil (Sri Lanka)  Origin Genus Oci­mum is wide­spread over Asia, Africa and Central and Southern America; it ap­pears to have its center of di­versi­ty in Africa. Most species pre­fer tropical climate .  The culinary herb basil (O. basilicum) is a sun loving plant of the Medi­terranean region; its origin is, how­ever, not known. It was usually assumed to originate from India, as there some of its close relatives grow wildly; however, as it is attested in the Medi­terranean since 3000 years (Egypt), some doubt may be raised. Newer literature openly speculates whether basil could be a native of West Asia. Today, basil is cultivated in many Asian and Medi­terranean countries; main exporters (for the Euro­pean market) are France, Italy, Morocco and Egypt. There is also signi­ficant basil production in California.          Lemon-scented Indian wild basil   The Sacred Basil (or Holy Basil) of India (O. tenui­florum) also has a long history of culti­vation, being de­scribed in the Indic Vedas, roughly 3000 years ago. In the wild state, it is found in tro­pical Asia and Africa; mostly, an origin in India is assumed.  The species known as East-Indian tree basil (O. gratissimum) also has a distribution over  Africa and Asia, but in that case, the higher diversity makes it likely that the species originated in Africa.           Basil Wild Purple, a red-leaved variety (O. canum × O. basilicum) © Sabine Amtsberg           Purple-leaved basil flowers           Anthocyan containing basil cultivar Ruby  Etymology The name basil is derived from Greek basileus [βασιλεύς] king, because of the royal fra­grance of this herb. The names of basil in almost all Euro­pean lan­guages are related, al­though they show some vowel variation: Icelandic basilíka, Belarusian bazylik [базылік], Serbo­croatian bosiljak [босиљак], Albanian bozilok, Czech bazalka, Hungarian bazsalikom, Romanian busuioc, Provençal baseli, Basque brasilla and Modern Greek vasilikos [βασιλικός]. In the era of colonialism, that name was also transferred to a few African languages, e. g., Ewe bebusui and Amharic besobila [በሶቢለ].  The Greek word basileus [βασιλεύς] king means essen­tially people’s leader. The first element derives from bainein [βαίνειν] go, which quite surpris­ingly is cognate to English come and the syn­onymous Latin venire, the common Proto-Indo–European verbal root being GʷEM. The connection is made more obvious if we consider the Mycenaean Greek form of gwasileus [𐀣𐀯𐀩𐀄] lord. The second element is laos [λαός] people, which has no cognates in Modern English, for Old English  leod has been aban­doned in favour of Ro­mance people; related are  German Leute, Old French liode, Lithua­nian liaudis and Rus­sian lyudi [люди]  people and Latin liber free man (Proto-Indo–European root LEUDʰ grow upwards).          Anthocyan containing basil cultivar Ruby   Names like Italian erba reale and French herbe royal royal herb, or German Königs­kraut and Dutch konings­kruid king’s herb are probably calqued from the Greek name. Despite its independent origin, the Quenya name asea aranion [ ] bears the same as­socia­tion: aran [] king.  Iberic names of basil (Spanish albahaca, Portuguese alfavaca and Catalan alfàbrega, also Basque albaraka) are Arabic loans, as might be inferred from the prefix al-. The original Arabic form is al-habaqa [الحبق] the basil; cf. also Maltese ħabaq and Aramaic hauk [ܚܘܟ], and see caper for more examples of Arabic vocabulary in Spanish and Portuguese.           African wild basil O. canum           Wild basil, O. canum pharm1.pharmazie.uni-greifswald.de   In contempo­rary Arabic as spoken in Asia and the Eastern Medi­terra­nean, habaq [حبق] has become rather un­com­mon and mostly sup­planted by ar-raihan [الريحان]. The latter name has close relatives in many lan­guages of the Middle East, e. g., Turkish reyhan, Hebrew rehan [ריחן], Georgian rehani [რეჰანი], Kurdish dhaihan [ذةیحان] and Farsi rihan [ریحان]. Note, however, that Turkish dağ reyhanı mountain basil means savory.  Raihan is derived from Arabic rih [ريح] or riha [ريحة] odour, fra­grance and origi­nally did not mean basil but another aromatic Medi­terra­nean plant, myrtle. This is still so in North African Arabic (and Maltese); moreover, the word has been transferred to medieval Spanish as arrayán myrtle.  The genus name Ocimum is a latinized version of the Greek plant name okimon [ὤκιμον], by which basil is referred to in the work of Dioskurides. It derives from the verb  ozein [ὄζειν] smell (cf. ozone the smelling one, directly from the Greek present participle ozon [ὄζον]) and English odour).           African camphor basil, , O. kilimandscharicum   Indic names for holy basil, e. g., Telugu tulsi­chettu [తుళసిచెట్టు], Tamil tulasi [துளசி] and Hindi tulsi [तुलसी], derive from Sanskrit tulasi [तुलसी]; for the latter name, no satis­fying etymo­logy is known. To distin­guish holy basil more clearly from its wild relatives, com­pound names are used, e. g., Hindi jangli­tulsi [जंगलितुलसी] forest basil to denote O. gratissimum.          African camphor basil, , O. kilimandscharicum   Hindu cult pre­fers red-leaved vari­eties of Sacred Basil; and such strains are often re­ferred to by colour adjec­tives: Urdu kali tulsi [کالی تلسی] or Hindi krishna tulsi [कृष्ण तुलसी] dark/black basil. In Kerala, I have seen O. gratis­simum being called rama­tulasi [രാമതുളസി], which appears to be the un­expected side-effect of a re-inter­pretion of the name of red-leaved Sacred Basil, krishna­tulasi [കൃഷ്ണതുളസി]: The latter was inter­preted to refer not to the colour but to the Hindu god Krishna (the eighth and most famous avatar of Vishnu), and thus the related but dif­ferent green plant got associated with Rama, the seventh avatar. In Nepal, the term ramtulsi [रामतुलसी] may also mean a wild type of oregano.  The Vietnamese name  rau que [rau quế] cinnamon plant (emphasized hung que [húng quế] cinnamon basil) alludes to the sweet–aromatic odour of some cultivars like Thai horapha, although this is more close to anise than to cinnamon. There are indeed cinnamon-flavoured basil varieties, but these are, to my knowledge, not known in Vietnam.

  "": "The name basil is derived from Greek basileus [βασιλεύς] king, because of the royal fra­grance of this herb. The names of basil in almost all Euro­pean lan­guages are related, al­though they show some vowel variation: Icelandic basilíka, Belarusian bazylik [базылік], Serbo­croatian bosiljak [босиљак], Albanian bozilok, Czech bazalka, Hungarian bazsalikom, Romanian busuioc, Provençal baseli, Basque brasilla and Modern Greek vasilikos [βασιλικός]. In the era of colonialism, that name was also transferred to a few African languages, e. g., Ewe bebusui and Amharic besobila [በሶቢለ].  The Greek word basileus [βασιλεύς] king means essen­tially people’s leader. The first element derives from bainein [βαίνειν] go, which quite surpris­ingly is cognate to English come and the syn­onymous Latin venire, the common Proto-Indo–European verbal root being GʷEM. The connection is made more obvious if we consider the Mycenaean Greek form of gwasileus [𐀣𐀯𐀩𐀄] lord. The second element is laos [λαός] people, which has no cognates in Modern English, for Old English  leod has been aban­doned in favour of Ro­mance people; related are  German Leute, Old French liode, Lithua­nian liaudis and Rus­sian lyudi [люди]  people and Latin liber free man (Proto-Indo–European root LEUDʰ grow upwards).          Anthocyan containing basil cultivar Ruby   Names like Italian erba reale and French herbe royal royal herb, or German Königs­kraut and Dutch konings­kruid king’s herb are probably calqued from the Greek name. Despite its independent origin, the Quenya name asea aranion [ ] bears the same as­socia­tion: aran [] king.  Iberic names of basil (Spanish albahaca, Portuguese alfavaca and Catalan alfàbrega, also Basque albaraka) are Arabic loans, as might be inferred from the prefix al-. The original Arabic form is al-habaqa [الحبق] the basil; cf. also Maltese ħabaq and Aramaic hauk [ܚܘܟ], and see caper for more examples of Arabic vocabulary in Spanish and Portuguese.           African wild basil O. canum           Wild basil, O. canum pharm1.pharmazie.uni-greifswald.de   In contempo­rary Arabic as spoken in Asia and the Eastern Medi­terra­nean, habaq [حبق] has become rather un­com­mon and mostly sup­planted by ar-raihan [الريحان]. The latter name has close relatives in many lan­guages of the Middle East, e. g., Turkish reyhan, Hebrew rehan [ריחן], Georgian rehani [რეჰანი], Kurdish dhaihan [ذةیحان] and Farsi rihan [ریحان]. Note, however, that Turkish dağ reyhanı mountain basil means savory.  Raihan is derived from Arabic rih [ريح] or riha [ريحة] odour, fra­grance and origi­nally did not mean basil but another aromatic Medi­terra­nean plant, myrtle. This is still so in North African Arabic (and Maltese); moreover, the word has been transferred to medieval Spanish as arrayán myrtle.  The genus name Ocimum is a latinized version of the Greek plant name okimon [ὤκιμον], by which basil is referred to in the work of Dioskurides. It derives from the verb  ozein [ὄζειν] smell (cf. ozone the smelling one, directly from the Greek present participle ozon [ὄζον]) and English odour).           African camphor basil, , O. kilimandscharicum   Indic names for holy basil, e. g., Telugu tulsi­chettu [తుళసిచెట్టు], Tamil tulasi [துளசி] and Hindi tulsi [तुलसी], derive from Sanskrit tulasi [तुलसी]; for the latter name, no satis­fying etymo­logy is known. To distin­guish holy basil more clearly from its wild relatives, com­pound names are used, e. g., Hindi jangli­tulsi [जंगलितुलसी] forest basil to denote O. gratissimum.          African camphor basil, , O. kilimandscharicum   Hindu cult pre­fers red-leaved vari­eties of Sacred Basil; and such strains are often re­ferred to by colour adjec­tives: Urdu kali tulsi [کالی تلسی] or Hindi krishna tulsi [कृष्ण तुलसी] dark/black basil. In Kerala, I have seen O. gratis­simum being called rama­tulasi [രാമതുളസി], which appears to be the un­expected side-effect of a re-inter­pretion of the name of red-leaved Sacred Basil, krishna­tulasi [കൃഷ്ണതുളസി]: The latter was inter­preted to refer not to the colour but to the Hindu god Krishna (the eighth and most famous avatar of Vishnu), and thus the related but dif­ferent green plant got associated with Rama, the seventh avatar. In Nepal, the term ramtulsi [रामतुलसी] may also mean a wild type of oregano.  The Vietnamese name  rau que [rau quế] cinnamon plant (emphasized hung que [húng quế] cinnamon basil) alludes to the sweet–aromatic odour of some cultivars like Thai horapha, although this is more close to anise than to cinnamon. There are indeed cinnamon-flavoured basil varieties, but these are, to my knowledge, not known in Vietnam.
