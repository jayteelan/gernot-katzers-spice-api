  "used-plant-part": "In the Euro­pean Alps (Switzer­land, Italy), all aerial parts are har­vested at flowering time and always used dried, as a light green powder. Yet, in the Cau­casus (Georgia), the dried seeds are used as a spice; they are ground to­gether with their pods to yield a tan powder. ",
  "plant-family": "Fabaceae (bean family) ",
  "sensory-quality": "Dried blue fenugreek leaves have an aromatic, spicy flavour, similar to dried fenugreek herb, but somewhat milder. Also the dried seeds somehow remind to lightly toasted fenu­greek seeds, although they are less bitter and more pleasant. ",
  "main-constituents": "According to a some­what older publication, α‑keto-acids are respon­sible for the flavour of blue fenu­greek: pyruvic acid, α‑keto glutaric acid, α‑keto isovalerianic acid and even α‑keto isocapronic acid. (Gordian,  86,  9, 1986)  This is astonishing: From considering related plants, one would have expected five-membered hetero­cycles (as in the closely related fenugreek) or coumarins (as in the related genus Melilotus, honey clover). On the other side, reaction of α‑ketocarboxylic acids towards heterocycles has been observed during wine storage. (Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 43, 2616, 1995)  Unfortunately, there appears to be no newer scientific work on the flavour components of this spice.          Blue fenugreek plant   In the seeds of blue fenu­greek, dios­genin glyco­sides were found which also ap­pear in fenu­greek seeds. Ap­parent­ly, they have yet found any pharma­ceutical application. Origin Blue fenu­greek is found in the Alps, in the moun­tains of East­ern and South East­ern Europe and in the Cau­casus. Etymology The German name Schabzieger­klee (usually spelt Schabziger­klee in Swiss German) alludes to the herb’s usage in cheese making, for Ziger is a regional, mostly Swiss, word for the milk proteins (casein) that remain after the whey has been separated. Cf. Zigerkraut herb for Ziger.  Most other names allude to the characteristic blue flowers, which distinguishes blue fenugreek from its relatives of genera Trigonella, Trifolium and Melilotus.

Yet some other names are moti­vated by the aro­matic fra­grance of blue fenu­greek: Italian balsamo (see lemon balm for more ex­plana­tions on balsam) and French trèfle musque musky trefoil (see also nut­meg) or lotier odorant fragrant trefoil.  English blue has cognates in many Germanic languages, e. g. German blau, Icelandic blár, Swedish blå and Yiddish bloy [בלױ]. The English word took a more complicated route: It was borrowed from Old French bleu, which itself was taken from a Germanic source (root BLĒWA blue). The Proto-Indo–European root behind these names was reconstructed as BʰEL and is the progenitor of a number of adjectives for various, typically bright, colours: Latin flavus golden yellow (cf. English blond), Russian bielyj [белый] white (see white mustard) and Welsh blawar grey. English bleach and black are also part of that group (see nigella).          Blue fenugreek inflorescence   Romance lan­guages have two terms for blue: Italian ceruleo derives from Latin coelum sky. On the other hand, French azure, Italian azzurro and Spanish azul have a more com­plicated history that relates to the semi-precious stone lapis lazuli. The stone is named for an ancient mine location in today’s North­ern Afghani­stan and was trans­ferred west­wards as Persian lazhward [لاژورد] and Arabic lazward [لازورد]; there, the name of the stone was to denote the colour, and the initial L was mis­identified as the Arabic definite article and removed.           Blue fenugreek flowers   The term clover is in use for the several species species of the pea family, especially such with three-partite leaves. It is restricted to Germanic languages, e. g., German Klee, Dutch klaver, Danish kløver. The origin of that name is unknown, although it is attested in the oldest Germanic tongues, as Old English clafre and Old High German klēo (genitive case: klewes).          Blue fenugreek flowers   English has an­other general name for clover-like plants, tre­foil. This is of Ro­mance origin (cf. French trèfle, Catalan trèvol, Ro­manian trifoi) and ulti­mately de­rives from Latin tri­folium clover, tre­foil, which literally means three-leaf. See lemon verbena for the etymo­logy of Latin folium leaf.  Some European languages have yet another name for cloves which derives from Latin  lotus; examples are French  lotier and English melilot for the related genus Melilotus, which means honey-clover (see bear’s garlic for the first part of that name). The Ancient Greek name lotos [λωτός] denoted several different plants, not only clovers (also the related fenugreek) but also the lotus plant (Nelumbo nucifera) which is a sacred flower in Hinduism and Buddhism.
