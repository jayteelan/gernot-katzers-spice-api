    "origin": "Medi­terranean. ",
    "etymology": "Chaste tree carries several sacred names, which more or less directly refer to its reputation as an anaphrodisiac. In ancient Greece, the tree was called agnos [ἄγνος], which apparently the early Christians confused both with a similar Greek term hagnos [ἁγνός] chaste, and with Latin agnus lamb, the Christian symbol of purity. Under the name agnus castus chaste lamb, the plants was often used among Christian monks as a help against the evils of the more fleshy desires, of which there were many.           Chaste tree inflorescence           White chaste tree inflorescence             Chaste tree (sterile plant)   Still today, there are many names in European lan­guages alluding to this use of chaste tree (which, I keep hearing, is not so much in demand now). There are several names meaning tree of chastity (English chaste tree or Dutch kuisboom) or monk’s pepper (French poivre des moines,  Maltese bżar tal-Patrijiet, Estonian munga­pipar). Another group of names refers to the Biblical patriarch Abraham: Russian Avraamovo derevo [Авраамово дерево] Abraham’s tree, Hebrew siah avraham [שיח-אברהם] Abraham’s bush and last but not least English Abraham’s balm (see lemon balm about balm).  The genus name Vitex allegedly derived from Latin vitilis made by plaiting, because the flexible branches of the tree were used in the construction of plaited fences (note that willow has similar seman­tics). Compare also Modern Greek lygagria [λυγαγριά], probably related to Old Greek lygizein [λυγίζειν] bend (see also garlic for further related words). "

(Phytochemistry, 41, 1201, 1996)            Annatto flower           Annatto flower and immature pods   Origin The annatto tree is a tropical plant native to the Carib­bean islands, conti­nental Central America and the western part of South America.  The tree has been introduced to the tropics all over the world; nevertheless, the main producing area is still in South America (Perú, Brazil). Among the Asian countries, India, Sri Lanka and the Philippines have small-scale annatto production; in other tropical countries, it is mostly planted as an ornamental.           Ripe annatto pod clusters growing on a tree in pendant position  Etymology The scientific species name orellana is derived from the name of Francisco de Orellana  (1511–1546), a Spanish explorer of the 16.th century who had taken part in various expeditions to the New World, securing colonies for the Spanish crown.  Together with Francisco Pizarro, Orellana had been involved in the destruction of the Inca Empire; in 1540, he participated in another expedition led by Gonzalo Pizarro. Following false rumours about gold and cinnamon trees, about 2000 Spaniards entered the Peruvian and Brazilian jungles, where most of them perished. Orellana aban­doned the party and made his way eastward, where he (more or less by chance) discovered the Amazon River and earned scientific fame quite undeservedly.           Annatto pod cluster with central pod already dry and open, exposing the seeds           Ripe Annatto pods   By confusion of the Spanish name with the French town Orleans, the German name Orlean­strauch, literally meaning shrub of Orleans emerged.  Other names of this plant all stem from Indio tongues in Central and South America. Most languages derive their names for this plant from Carib annatto, which is loaned mostly in unaltered shape. The Tupi-Guarani term urucul (in the Amazon region) has also been borrowed by some languages, e. g., French rocou, Portuguese urucú and presumably Manipuri ureirom [উরৈরোম, ꯎꯔꯩꯔꯣꯝ]. In México, the spice is known as achiote in the Náhuatl language; that name is commonly used in the USA and has also entered a few more languages (Arabic atshiut [آتشيوت] and Bulgarian achyote [ачиоте]). The scientific genus name, Bixa, was taken from another Carib plant name usually transcribed as bija or biché.  English lipstick tree refers to the cosmetic use of the plant, and Russian pomadnoe derevo [помадное дерево] ointment tree was probably given in a similar vein. Using the annatto dye for cosmetic products is largely obsolete, but usage of annatto for ritual bodypaint is rather ancient, being reported from pre-Colombian Aztecs.

Most imports stem from Ghana. In the countries of origin, the seeds are used not only to flavour food, but they are also chewed on cold days to warm the body. Etymology  In the Middle Ages, the spice was termed grana paradisi grains of paradise because of its high value. This name also mirrors the medieval conception of an earthly paradise full of the scent of spices. Many contemporary languages have loan translations of that name, e. g., German Paradieskörner, Czech rajská zrna and Portu­guese grãos-do-paraíso, Roma­nian grăun­țele para­disului (grăun­ţele para­disului) and Hun­garian para­dicsom­mag, all of which mean seeds of para­dise or  grains of para­dise (note the plural in­volved).  Hebrew uses the Biblical term Eden [עֵדֶן] in forming the name gargeri gan ha-eden [גרגרי גן העדן] grains from the garden of Eden. The Chinese name tian-guo gu-li [天國穀粒] grains from the heavenly realm involves the Chinese religious term for heaven, tian-guo.  Most languages have names like pepper of Guinea referring to the biting taste and the region of origin in West Africa. Examples are French poivre de Guinée, Portuguese pimenta Guiné and German Guinea­pfeffer; similar is Czech Guinejská zrna Guinea grains. In some languages, the the botanical epithet applies not to pepper but to spices botanically related to grains of paradise: Korean kinia senggang [기니아생강] ginger of Guinea or Slovak Guinejský kardamon cardamom of Guinea. Cf. also Lithuanian imbierpipiri ginger pepper.          Fresh grain of paradise pod © Josh Weber   The element mala­gueta ap­pears in many names of grains of para­dise, with consider­able ortho­graphic vari­ation. The spice is com­monly termed mala­gueta pepper, e. g., Czech pepř mala­guetský, Bul­garian melegeta piper [мелегета пипер] and Greek piperi melenketa [πιπέρι μελεγκέτα]; an­other possible compound is melegueta grains (Italian grani de Meleguetta). Although the etymology is not clear, it appears that the name was originally not an epithet for pepper, but an independent name. Some languages still use it as such, e. g., French maniguette, Russian malagvet [малагвет] and, quite significantly, Spanish malagueta (besides the longer pimienta de malagueta).  The medieval Spanish and Portuguese form of that word was  malagueta; a theory links it to malagua, a now less-common term for jellyfish or medusa (literally bad water, because jellyfish-infested waters are no good for bathing). The reference would, then, be the pungent, biting flavour of the spice. See water pepper for the etymology of Portuguese água water.  According to another theory, the base word is an Iberic cognate to Italian meligo sorghum, millet, although the diminutive appears less plausible. Also, borrowing from an African tongue has been suggested.  In Brazil, which was a Portuguese colony, the name melegueta was transferred to a local wild type of chile.

Three similar and often confused spices: Fruits of ajwain (upper left), radhuni (upper right) and celery (lower half). 600 dpi scan.  ",
    "etymology": "English ajwain or ajwan is just the ro­man­ized spelling of the Hindi name ajvan [अजवायन, अजवान]. Most Eu­ro­pean lan­guages have similar names, although the spelling is some­times varied, e. g., in Dutch ajowan or German Adiowan. The Hindi name can be traced back to Sanskrit yavanaka [यवनक] or yavani [यवानी], which is derived from the adjective yavana [यवन] Greek. Modern Northern and Southern Indian names like Nepali javano [जवानो], Gujarati yavano [યવણો], Bengali jowan [জোয়ান], Punjabi aijavain [ਐਜਵਾਇਨ] and Tamil omam [ஓமம்] have the same source. This suggests that the spice originated from the Eastern Mediterranean and arrived in India in the course of the Greek conquest of Central Asia.  The Sanskrit term yavana for Greece belongs to the same kin as Arabic al-Yunan [اليونان], Tajiki Yunon [Юнон], Armenian Hounastan [Հունաստան], Azeri Yunanıstan and Hebrew yavan [יוון], which all derive from the name of a Greek tribe, the Ionians (classical name Iones [Ἱώες] contracted from Iaones [Ἱάονες], archaic Iavones [Ἱάϝονες]).  Another group of names for ajwain is derived from Sanskrit ajamoda [अजमोद] or ajamodika [अजमोदिका]. Examples in modern Indian languages include Kannada ajamoda [ಅಜಮೋದ] and Sinhala asamodagam [අසමෝදගම්]. However, very similar or even identical names are often used for another, related Indian spice (Trachyspermum/Carum roxburghianum), which is known in Bengal cuisine as radhuni [রাধুনি] (see also nigella).  Radhuni is often confounded with celery, and the latter takes the name of the former in some Indian languages because the two plants have very similar flavour. Note also that celery and parsley are not much discriminated in India; so Hindi and Urdu ajmud [अजमूद, اجمود] may mean both parsley and celery. To make things worse, the fruits (seeds) of all these plants look very similar, giving rise to further complications.  That Indian name was also transferred to Ethiopia as azmud [አዝሙድ], which is, however, used to designate two different plants: Ajwain is termed netch azmud [ነጭ አዝሙድ] white azmud, whereas tiqur azmud [ጥቁር አዝሙድ] black azmud means nigella.          Ajwain flowers   Some European and Western Asian lan­guages relate ajwain to Egypt: Turkish mısır anason Egyptian anise or Finnish koptilainen kumina Coptic caraway. Indeed, there is ajwain culti­vation in Egypt, but it is not certain whether ajwain was originally native to Egypt. Note the seem­ingly similar Slovak name egyptská čierna rasca Egyptian black caraway which, however, does not refer to ajwain but to nigella.  I cannot explain the Arabic name al-kamun al-muluki [الكمون الملوكي] cumin of the king. Yet there is an interesting parallel in the materia medica of Dioskurides: The description of a herb ammios [ἄμμιος] comes very close to ajwain, and Dioskurides remarks that the plant is also known as Ethiopian or Royal cumin. Old German pharmaceutical catalogues often name ajwain as Königskümmel king’s caraway which is probably derived from either of these two sources. Quite typically for older German herbal literature, there is confusion between cumin and caraway.  Note that the term royal cumin (or imperial cumin) may also be used for a rare Indian spice which I prefer to call black cumin.  The motivation behind the English name bishop’s weed is not clear to me. In any case, this name should best be avoided as it is also used for other plants of the Apiaceae family, e. g., Aegopodium podagraria (also known as ground elder or goutweed) and Ammi visnaga, which is more often known as toothpickweed or by its Arabic name, khella [خلة].

Many, if not most, of the brands of Wasabi powder and wasabi paste are actually fakes and consist mainly of coloured horseradish. When buying, remember that wasabi can never be cheap.  In Japan, fresh wasabi leaves are often used as an aromatic decoration. ",
    "plant-family": "Brassicaceae (cabbage family). ",
    "sensory-quality": "Strongly pungent and lachrymatory, like horseradish, but somewhat more pure and fresh. See negro pepper for more about pungent spices. It should be noted that the pungent taste is not discernible in the dried root until it has been treated with water for a few minutes. If tried without previous contact with water, it tastes bitter (see also zedoary). ",
    "main-constituents": "Like its relatives in the cabbage family, wasabi owes its pungency to isothiocyanates. Two glucosinolates have been identified in the root: Sinigrin (90%), which is also the characteristic aroma compound of black mustard and horseradish, and traces of glucocochlearin. These tasteless compounds are enzymatically hydrolyzed to the pungent mustard oils allyl isothiocyanate (CH2=CH–CH2–NCS) and sec-butyl isothiocyanate (CH3–CH2–CH(CH3)–NCS), respectively. Isothiocyanate total of fresh wasabi is around 0.2%.           Wasabi flower www.utougi.com   Further trace com­ponents identified in the volatile fraction are 6-methyl­thio­hexyl iso­thiocyanate, 7-methyl­thio­heptyl iso­thiocyanate and 8-methyl­thio­ocytl iso­thiocyanate. These compounds, ω-methyl­thio­alkyl iso­thiocyanates, are characteristic for wasabi and are often suspected to be responsible for the character­istic taste so much loved by Japanese connoisseurs. Short-chain homologues of these compounds appear, however, also in the Italian herb rocket. ",
    "origin": "Japan. The plant is very difficult to grow, as it does best in flowing water; roots grown traditionally on the banks of mountain streams (sawa wasabi [沢山葵, さわ山葵, さわわさび]) are considered better than those grown with modern hydroponic technology. More recently, wasabi cultivation has been tried in New Zealand and in the West of America to cater to the Japanese community. ",
    "etymology": "In Chinese, wasabi is known as shan kui [山葵] (literally mountain sunflower). The name wasabi, which has entered most Western languages, is Japanese. In Japan,  wasabi was originally written in Kanji as 和佐比 which would be read wasahi in modern language; but this notation is no longer used. Instead, the plant’s name is usually written in Hiragana [わさび] or sometimes in Katakana [ワサビ]. The modern Japanese Kanji writing [山葵] parallels the Chinese, but is uncommon due to its irregularity: The single kanji mean  yama [山] mountain and aoi [葵] holly­hock. The plant name holly­hock refers to Althea rosea, an ornamental closely related to marshmallow, but unrelated to wasabi. Note that although the name is written yama aoi, it is always spoken wasabi.  See Sichuan pepper for a more detailed explanation of Kanji readings.           A basket of wasabi roots. www.utougi.com   Nevertheless, there are some European names for wasabi that translate the Kanji literally as mountain holly­hock, e. g., Dutch berg­stokroos or German Berg­stockrose. The equivalent English name, mountain holly­hock, more often refers to a true relative of holly­hock, Iliamna rivularis (Malvaceae/Malvales/Dilleniidae), than to wasabi.  Many Western languages have borrowed the Japanese name to denote wasabi, sometimes adjusting the word to their own sound system. Some languages use descriptive compounds that name wasabi as a variant of the better-known horseradish, e. g., French raifort du Japon, Dutch Japanse mierikswortel, Russian Yaponskij khren [Японский хрен] and Finnish japaninpiparjuuri, all of which mean Japanese horseradish. Another interpretation of wasabi’s nature is reflected by the Hungarian name zöldtorma green horseradish.  Japanese namida [涙, 泪, なみだ] means tear in everyday speech; if spoken in a sushi bar, however, it will be interpreted by the sushi cook as a wish for an extra-large amount of the lachrymatory wasabi.

    "used-plant-part": "Onion forms a bulb, this is, a cluster of sub­terranean leaves designed to store energy to allow for a rapid growth in spring.  Besides the bulb, the super­terranean green leaves can also put to culinary use, most often in the form of young onion plants (green onion or spring onion). Their flavour is more similar to chives (but stronger).  The spice named onion seeds is unrelated to onion, but stems from an entirely different plant, nigella. ",
    "plant-family": "Alliaceae (onion family). ",
    "sensory-quality": "In fresh state, onion is spicy, pungent and lachrymatory. For more information on hot and pungent spices, see negro pepper. On cooking, the flavour mellows and can become even sweet, depending on the exact cooking procedure. Dried onion has an aromatic, spicy odour and mild flavour. ",
    "main-constituents": "Fresh onions contain only traces (0.01%) of essential oil, which mostly consists of sulfur compounds: Ethyl and propyl disulfides, vinyl sulfide and other sulfides and thioles. The lachrymatory principle is variously identified as thiopropanal-S-oxide (CH3–CH2–C(SO)H) or  its tautomer propenyl sulfenic acid (CH3–CH=CH–SOH). This substance is released from its precursor S-1-propenyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide as a reaction to cell damage; this mechanism is very similar to that in garlic.  Onions contain significant amounts of flavonoides, e. g., quercetine glucosides. The red colour of some onion breeds is due to pigments of the anthocyanin type, which have been identified as cyanidin malonylglucosides. Total anthocyanin concentrations may be up to 200 ppm.           Inflorescence of Allium christophii (Persian onion)  ",
    "origin": "Onion seems to origi­nate from West or Central Asia, but it obviously reached the Mediterranean, in the cultivated state, several millennia ago. In Europe, it is known since the Bronze Age (see poppy about Iliad and Odyssey). ",
    "etymology": "Names of onion in Romance languages derive from Late Latin cepa onion and its diminutive, cepula; examples include Italian cipolla, Provençal cebo and Romanian ceapă; cf. also Albanian qepë.  Note, however, that many names of chives in Romance languages come from the same root and may be quite similar. Also German Zwiebel belongs to that kin; its similarity to zwei two is purely coincidental. There are a couple of related names in North and East European tongues, probably due to loans from German: Estonian sibul, Finnish sipuli, Slovak cibuľa, Yiddish tsibele [ציבעלע] and Ukrainian tsybulya [цибуля].  French oignon, English onion and Dutch ui derive from late Latin unio onion, probably related to unus one because of the single, perfectly shaped onion bulb in contrast to the multitude of garlic cloves. Another theory links unio with Sanskrit ushna [उष्ण] hot, passionate, pungent which can be used to denote onion.  Swedish lök,  Icelandic laukur and similar forms (also English leek for the related Allium porrum) all belong to a group of words further discussed  under garlic. Russian luk [лук] onion is a loan from a Germanic tongue.           Central Asian (Himalayan) species Allium giganteum           A. giganteum inflorescence   The Bulgarian name kromid [кромид] is borrowed from Greek kremmidi [κρεμμύδι]. The latter has a long history in Greek language and was already used by Homer, who tells us that the Greek heroes of the Iliad, more than 3000 years ago, used to eat onions with wine: kromyon poto opson [κρόμυον ποτῷ ὄψον] onion as a relish for the drink. It has a Sanskrit cognate, krimighna [कृमिघ्न]. See also bear’s garlic about more Indo–European words possibly related to kremmidi (via an Proto-Indo–European root KREM), and see poppy for more information on the Homeric epics.  The names of onion in Semitic tongues are still remarkably close: Arabic al-basal [البصل], Hebrew bazal [בצל], Tigré basal [በሰል] and Maltese basal. These derive from a common Semitic root ŠḤL with the basic meaning to peel. Arabic basal has been borrowed by Turkish in the Ottoman period, but is now abandoned in favour of the Altaic-derived soğan.  All the names of shallots derive from the Eastern Mediteranean seaport Askalon (today Ashqelon [אשקלון] in South Western Israel). There is a legend that crusaders discovered the plant there and subsequently introduced it to Europe;  yet  the city was known already in antiquity for its onions. The German regional name Klöben is related to English cleave, referring to the  several sub-bulbs of shallot. The same element is also found in Knoblauch, the German name of garlic.

    "note": "Many lan­gu­ages have similar names for leek, garlic and onion, or derive those names from a common base. ",
    "used-plant-part": " What is usually referred to as a head of garlic is, in botanical terms, a bulb, i. e., a sub­terranean reserve structure derived from a cluster of leaves. The single leaves are known as cloves of garlic.  Some cuisines make minor use of fresh garlic leaves. ",
    "plant-family": "Alliaceae (onion family). ",
    "sensory-quality": "Strong and charac­teristic odour, which is markedly different in fresh and fried state. The pungency of fresh garlic (see also negro pepper for pun­gent spices) van­ishes after cook­ing or fry­ing. ",
    "main-constituents-": "Garlic contains a wealth of sulfur compounds; most important for the taste is allicin (diallyl di­sulphide oxide), which is produced enzymati­cally from alliin (S-2-propenyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide) if cells are damaged; its biological function is to repel herbi­vorous animals. Allicin is deacti­vated to diallyl di­sulphide; therefore, minced garlic changes its aroma if not used imme­diately. In the essential oil from steam distil­lation, diallyl di­sulphide (60%) is found besides diallyl tri­sulphide (20%), diallyl sulfide, ajoene and minor amounts of other di- and poly­sulphides. Sulfur com­pounds of this kind are typical for the onion family; see also bear’s garlic, onion and chives.            Fresh Garlic heads            Dry garlic head    In other bo­tanical groups, garlic scent caused by similar sulphur chemism is un­com­mon. While the cab­bage family is rich in species ac­cumu­lating sulphur com­pounds (e. g., they cause the typical flavour of cress, mustard and the various cab­bage types), true garlic aroma is rarely found; an example for such a plant is hedge garlic (Alliaria petiolata). Asafetida is an important sulphur-containing spice that replaces garlic is some South Asian cuisines. Lastly, the exotic garlic vine (Cydista aequi­noctialis syn. Mansoa alliacea) should be mentioned: This South American creeper boasts of beautiful flowers and strikingly garlic-scented leaves.          Dry garlic head  Origin Garlic is be­lieved to stem from Central Asia, al­though no wild form is known; the closest match is Allium longi­cuspis from the Tianshan mountains in the border region between China and Kirgistan. Of the about 700 species of genus Allium, many are native to Central Asia, the center of diversity ranging from the Himalayas to Turkestan.          Young garlic plants  Etymology Garlic (Old English gārlēac) is a native Germanic word being com­posed of two ele­ments: The first ele­ment gar means spear and refers to the pointed leaves. It is cognate to Gothic gaida and Old High German ger, which has survived only in a number of German first names including my own.  That element ger is closely related to Old  Irish gae spear and Latin gæsum heavy javelin, which is often  thought a Celtic loan. A possibly related word is Greek chaios [χαῖος]  shepherd’s crook; all these forms could derive from an Proto-Indo–European root ǴʰAISO javelin.  There may be a remote connection to the verbal root ǴʰEI- set  something in motion, hurl (Sanskrit heti [हेति] missile, Langobardic gaida point of an arrow, also English ghost).  The second ele­ment  -lic (appearing in full form in the word leek) has plenty of cognates in other Germanic languages which generally mean either leek or onion, e. g., German Lauch, Swedish lök, Dutch look; there are also loans to non-Germanic languages (Russian luk [лук], Lithuanian lukai, Latvian ķiploki, Estonian küüslauk, Finnish laukka). The common explanation derives these words from an Proto-Indo–European verbal root LEUG meaning bend or turn, probably again referring to the leaves’ shape; cf.  Lithuanian  liaunas flexible and Greek lygizein [λυγίζειν] bend (see also chaste tree).           Garlic plant           Garlic flower cluster   In Scandina­vian lan­guages, cognates of leek have through­out adopted the meaning onion, e. g., Danish løg, Swedish lök or Icelandic laukur. The name of garlic is, then, formed, by prefixing an adjective white: Danish hvidløg, Swedish vitlök and Icelandic hvítlaukur. The white-element is cognate to English white (Old English hwīt); see white mustard for its deri­vation.  Similar naming motives reappear in some Eastern languages, e. g., Sinhala sudulunu [සූදුලුනු], Kannada bellulli [ಬೆಳ್ಳುಳ್ಳಿ] white onion, Garo rasin gipok, Bodo sambram gufut [सामब्राम गुफुत] white onion. and Indonesian bawang putih, where bawang is a general term for onion-related plants and putih means white (onion is red bawang). The Amharic name netch' shinkurt [ነጭ ሽንኩርት] also contains the element netch' [ነጭ] white. Lastly, a non-Germanic European example is Croatian bijeli luk and its Serbian counterpart beli luk [бели лук] white leek.          Garlic flower cluster   The Germanic runic letter for the sound L, ᛚ, is commonly known as lagu lake, body of water; there is evidence, though, that this rune was formerly termed laukaz, which might have meant onion or even more probably leek. Being efficient preservatives, leek and its relatives were considered powerful magic plants by Germanic peoples.  Note that also the runic alphabet was less used for practical than for cultic purposes. There are several mentions of lauk in the Poetic Edda: A nice example is found in the text  sigrdrífumál (Lay of Sigrdrífa), where the valkyr Sigrdifa gives an apotropaeic counsel concerning beverages (useful, e. g., against poisoning): ok verpa lauki í lög and cast leek into the liquor. Another example testifying to the high reputation of garlic comes from the guðrúnarkviða in forna (Second Lay of Guthrun), where the heroine Guthrun employs a garlicky metaphor for her deceased husband Sigurth: sem væri grænn laukr ór grasi vaxinn as the leek grows green above the grass, meaning that Sigurth surpassed all the other warriors.           Central Asian species Allium karataviense   The German na­me of garlic is Knob­lauch and cognate with Dutch knof­look; short forms in regional use include Knobi, Knofel and the Yiddish form knobl [קנאָבל]. Folk etymology holds that the first element knob- relates to knot (because the leaves of garlic are frequently tied together to improve growth of the subterranean parts), but  in truth, the initial kn cluster evolved from dis­simila­tion of earlier kl (Old High German kloba­louh, Middle High German klobe­louch). That element belongs to a verb stem klieb-, meaning split (cf. English cleave); deriving from Proto-Indo–European GLEUBʰ cut, carve, peel, it is related to Greek glyphis [γλυφίς] notch, mark and Latin glubere peel. The second element -lauch is, of course, equivalent to English -lic.  Independently, Slavonic names for garlic like Czech česnek, Slovenian česen, Polish czosnek, Ukrainian chasnyk [часник] and Russian chesnok [чеснок] also have a semantic connection to splitting and partitioning: Czech část, Polish część and Russian chast [часть] part.  An interesting comment can be made about the term clove of garlic. The English word clove has two culinarily relevant meanings, which one should never confuse: A subelement of a bulb (as in a clove of garlic) and an aromatic spice from the Moluccas. Both meanings are related; see cloves for details. Here, it should be noted that German Knoblauch and English clove are etymologically related and both hint on the cleavability of garlic bulbs. Garlic cloves are referred to as Zehen (meaning toes) in German.           Flower of A. karataviense (native to Turkestan)   The French name Thériaque des pauvres (Theriac of the poor) reflects the medical value of garlic. In the Middle Ages, an expensive and complicated mixture of mostly very exotic ingredients called theriac was believed to be extremely powerful against every kind of illness (snake bite, bone fracture, plague, …).  In classical Latin, garlic was termed allium, which is still the botanical genus name for garlic and related plants (leek, shallot, onion, bear’s garlic and chives). The origin of this word is not known. The only Indo–European cognate is Old Greek aglis [ἄγλις]; yet there have been attempts to link that word to a Celtic root all- burning, pungent. Most contemporary Romance languages have names for garlic that derive from allium, e. g., Italian aglio, French ail, Provençal aïo, Spanish ajo, Galician allo and Portuguese alho.  The botanical species name sativus means cultivated.  Hebrew shum [שום], already mentioned in the Old Testament (see pomegranate) and its cognates Arabic at-thum [الثوم], Aramaic and Tigré tum  [ܬܘܡ, ቱም] have a long history in Semitic languages, as exemplified by Akkadian šūmū; there is also a related Sumerian name, šum [𒋧, with plant determinative 𒋧𒊬]. Few non–Semitic tongues have borrowed that word, for example thom [थोम] in Dogri, an Indo–Aryan language spoken in the North Western corner of India.

Bulgarian levurda [левурда] was borrowed from Romanian.  I do not know what the associa­tions with bears are moti­vated by; allegedly, there is common belief that bears, after having ended their winter sleep in spring, first feed on bear’s garlic.  The name bear is common to all Germanic tongues (Old English bera, Old Norse bjǫrn); in contemporary languages, we have for example German Bär, Dutch beer or Swedish björn. The name is a euphemism originally signifying just the brown one, being derived from  an Proto-Indo–European root BʰER brown; an alternative, yet less plausible, explanation relates bear to Greek ther [θήρ] animal and Latin ferus wild (Proto-Indo–European ǴʰWER- beast).  It appears that the Germanic peoples avoided uttering the true name of the bear, fearing that the invocation of the name might make the dangerous animal appear.             Bear’s garlic (wilting leaves and unripe fruits)            Bear’s garlic, shortly before flower    A similar taboo concept lies behind Russian medved [медведь] and its Slavonic co­gnates with the literal meaning honey-eater. Russian med [мед] honey has relatives in almost any Indo–European language. In the Germanic languages, we find almost identical words for honey-wine: English mead (Old English meodu or medu), German Met and Icelandic mjöðr, all go back to Common Germanic MEDUZ. Non-Germanic examples include Latvian medus honey, Sanskrit madhu [मधु] sweet and Old Greek methy [μέθυ] (honey)­wine, which lies behind the name of a wine-coloured semi-precious stone, amethyst. All these cor­respond to an Proto-Indo–European root MEDʰU  meaning sweet; honey (see also licorice and almond for more sweet words). Inter­estingly, this root also appears in Proto-Finno–Ugric as METE, hinting at an extremely early contact between these two language families.           Bear’s garlic growing in a forest           Bear’s garlic, shortly before flower   Mead played a domi­nant rôle in an­cient Ger­manic culture. The beverage is mentioned in the very first song of the Poetic Edda, völuspá, as being drunk by the all-wise giant Mimir: dreccr miöð Mímir morgin hverian Mimir each morning his mead drinks. Ger­manic peoples of historical time were well known for their large consume of mead; Northern Ger­manic (Viking) kings had their throne typically in a large wooden mead-hall. Cf. also the multiple oc­curren­ces of mead in the Beowulf poem, and the name of Beowulf’s own hall, medu­seld mead-hall. The name Beowulf itself literally means bee-wolf and thus bear; the reference is that bears often steal honey from beehives.          Bear’s garlic in early springtime   The true Proto-Indo–European name of the bear is H₂R̥TḰOS, probably meaning destroyer; it appears in Latin ursus, Breton arzhed, Persian khers [خرس], Sanskrit riksha [ऋक्ष], and Greek arktos [ἄρκτος] bear; the latter term was also used to denote the constellation Great Bear (also known as the Great Dipper) and thus became a general term for north.          Bear’s garlic in early springtime           Flower head of bear’s garlic   Many langua­ges have a name for bear’s garlic signi­fying wild garlic: French ail sauvage, Greek agrio skordo [άγριο σκόρδο], Russian dikij chesnok [дикий чеснок], Hebrew shum habar [שום הבר] and Turkish yabanî sarımsak may serve as examples. Cf. also Chinese ye cong [野葱] wild onion. Another, less common, denomi­nation is garlic of the forest: Dutch wout­knoflook, yiddisch vald­knobl [װאַלדקנאָבל]  and Spanish ajo silvestre. Quite con­fusingly, the Bulgarian name div chesun [див чесън] wild garlic does not mean bear’s garlic but chives.  See also garlic.

In allspice fruits from Jamaica, eugenol (65% to 90%) is the main constituent; methyl eugenol is found in minor (10%) and myrcene in trace amounts (1%). Allspice from México is dominated by methyl eugenol (50 to 60%) with smaller amounts of myrcene (15%) and eugenol (10%).  The leaves contain less essential oil, but the content is high enough to make distillation profitable. In composition, it is similar to the essential oil from the fruits.

    "etymology": "Allspice became known in Europe long after it was first discovered by an expedition of Columbus;  because of the shape (similar to  pepper corns),  the new grains were termed pepper (whether by mistake or to gain more publicity I do not know). Still, they are called pepper in many languages, mostly with an attribute indicating their Caribbean origin or their aromatic scent. Examples for the former include Maghreb Arabic fulful mixik [فلفل مكسيك] Mexican pepper, Greek piperi Iamaïkis [πιπέρι Ιαμαϊκής], Basque Jamaikako piperbeltz and Russian Yamajskiy perets [Ямайский перец] Jamaica pepper; names of the latter type are represented by Swedish kryddpeppar condiment pepper, Latvian smaržīgie pipari flavour pepper, French poivre aromatique aromatic pepper and Arabic  fulful tabil [فلفل تابل] spicy pepper. A related group of names is German Nelkenpfeffer, Russian perets gvozdichnyj [перец гвоздичный] Hungarian szegfűbors and Czech hřebíčkový pepř, all of which mean clove pepper. See long pepper for the derivation of the name pepper.          Pipening allspice fruits           Allspice flowers   Some languages have names for all­spice meaning sweet pepper, e. g., South Ameri­can Spanish  pimienta dulce; cf. also Arabic filfil ifranji halu [فلفل إفرنجي حلو] sweet European pepper and Chinese gan jiao [甘椒] sweet Sichuan pepper. Such names, how­ever, can be easily con­fused with similar de­signa­tions refer­ring to paprika; Chinese is particularly con­fusing because paprika is called tian jiao [甜椒] which also means sweet Sichuan pepper.  In some languages, allspice is termed English spice (German englisches Gewürz or Yiddish english gewirts [ענגליש געװירץ]), English herb (Polish ziele angielskie, Belarusian angeĺskae zelle [ангельскае зелле]) or English pepper (Hebrew pilpel angli [פלפל אנגלי]). These names are motivated by the British colonial possessions in Jamaica, which enabled British vendors to supply allspice almost exclusively to European customers; moreover, allspice was (and is) quite popular in British cooking.           Immature fruits of Pimenta racemosa   German Neu­gewürz and Czech nové koření newspice, too, refer to allspice’s origin from the  New World (or, alter­natively, to the late point in history when it became known in the West). The same meaning has Turkish yeni­bahar (yeni new and bahar spice), which was also adopted by Romanian (enibahar) during the period of the Ottoman Turk Empire. Cf. also Bulgarian bakhar [бахар] and Greek bahari [μπαχάρι]. The original Arabic word, bahar [بهار] spice, is rarely used in the meaning allspice.  Lastly, English allspice and similar formations in other languages (German Allgewürz, French toute-épice and Chinese bi wei hu jiao [百味胡椒] hundred flavour pepper) reflect the complex aroma of this spice. Loanwords modelled on English allspice appear in some Asian languages, e. g., Thai olspais [ออลสไปซ์], Korean olsupaisu [올스파이스] and Japanese orusupaisu [オールスパイス].  The genus name Pimenta comes from Spanish pimienta for black pepper; it has a confusing history. In Late Latin, the word pigmentum dye (from Proto-Indo–European  PEIG to color) took a new, additional meaning, spice, condiment. The Iberic languages, then, formed their word for pepper not from Latin piper pepper, but from said pigmentum: Spanish pimienta, Portuguese pimenta (in Catalan language, however, pebre pepper has been conserved regionally).  Since allspice was initially also termed pimienta by the Spaniards, who alone imported the spice to 16.th century Europe, the name was, together with the spice, introduced into many European languages, e. g., Ukrainian piment [пімент] allspice.  Contemporary Spanish has the name in two versions: The feminine form pimienta denotes pepper and the masculine pimiento is paprika, perhaps because it is the stronger spice. However, derived names for other spices always use pimienta, for example pimienta picante hot pepper meaning chile. Allspice is called pimienta dulce  sweet pepper, which must not be confused with pimiento dulce, for the latter is a sweet paprika powder.  The genus name dioica  (Greek di-  from dyo [δύο] two, oikos [ὀῖκος]  house) indicates that there male and female flowers grow on  different plants; botanists call such plants dioecious.  Allspice, however, is not a perfext example of a dioecious plant, because male trees may bear a small number of hermaphrodic flowers which develop into fruits (polygamo-dioecious). "

    "sensory-quality": "Sweet almond have a faint, nutty fragrance and taste; bitter almonds taste strongly bitter and develop an intensive, characteristic aroma with moisture (e. g., by chewing). ",
    "main-constituents": "Almonds (bitter as well as sweet) contain about 50% of a fixed oil, which is, though, too expensive to be used for cooking. It is made up of glycerides (80% oleic acid, 15% linoleic acid, 5% palmitic acid).           Very young almond fruits   Bitter almonds contain 3 to 5% amygdalin, a so-called cyanogenic glycoside composed of mandelic nitrile and gentobiose. Vegetative parts of the almond tree accumulate the analogous prunasin (with glucose as sugar component). Amygdalin is occasionally referred to as Vitamin B17, primarily in the context of obscure cancer therapies.  On enzymatic hydrolysis of these glycosides by β-glucosidases, the aglycon mandelic nitrile (2-hydroxy-3-phenylacetonitrile) is liberated. A second enzyme (mandelonitrile lyase) converts mandelic nitrile quickly to benzaldehyde  (C6H5–CHO) and hydrocyanic acid (HCN, also known as prussic acid). By chance, both compounds are olfactorily similar, but hydrocyanic acid is highly toxic; bitter almonds’ value as a spice is only due to the benzaldehyde.  Hydrocyanic acid is a dangerous poison (about one twentieth of a gram is considered lethal for an adult), but it is also very volatile and susceptible to hydrolysis at higher temperatures. Therefore, significant amounts of hydrocyanic acid are highly unlikely to accumulate in any dish prepared with bitter almonds. On the other side, incorporation of whole raw bitter almonds is fairly dangerous because, in this case, all of its hydrocyanic acid is formed in one’s stomach. Serious poisoning is quite rare with adults, but children may be killed by just a few bitter almonds. Very similar warnings hold for other plants of the genus Prunus, the kernels of which all contain amygdalin (though in smaller amounts): Peach, apricot and, to an even lesser extent, cherry and plum. One kernel of bitter almond yields about one milligram of hydrocyanic acid.           Almond flowers           Almond flower www.botanikus.de   It should be noted that bitter almonds can only develop their aroma if both water and the necessary enzymes are present. The two enzymes (called together emulsin) are de­activated by heat; thus, bitter almonds must never be fried nor toasted, for they will not develop almond aroma afterwards. Sweet almonds are, by centuries of cultivation and breeding, very low in amygdalin and, thus, harmless; however, even sweet almond trees sometimes yield single bitter almonds (up to 1% of total crop), and some sweet almond cultivars still contain traces of bitter almond aroma. This does not apply to Californian almonds, which can be regarded totally destitute of amygdalin. Principally, sweet and bitter almonds are very different products and can never substitute each other.  ",
    "origin": "The origin of almonds is variously given as West or Central Asia; yet due to many millennia of cultivation, their original distribution cannot be reconstructed. In temperate Europe, almond trees do not thrive, although their cultivation has been tried in the Middle Ages due to the Capitulare de villis (see lovage). Today, the most important producers for the European market are Spain and Italy. Californian almonds are of increasing importance. ",
    "etymology": "Almonds’ names in almost all European tongues essentially derive from Greek amygdale [ἀμυγδάλη] or amygdalos [ἀμύγδαλος] almond, whose origin is  not known. The element al- got attached to the English and Spanish names  by confusion with the prefix al- in many Arabic loan words found in  Romance tongues; see also caper on this topic.           Almond flowers           Almond flowers   Arabic al-lawz [اللوز] is reflected in some other languages like Maltese lewż or Swahili lozi; I do not know of its origin, but there is probably a relation to Pahlavi lawzenag which denotes a sweetmeat prepared from almonds, probably smilar to today’s marzipan. Maybe there is also a conncetion to Akkadian  lūku [𒄑𒇴] almond tree. Another Old Semitic term, Akkadian šiqdu and Ugaritic thaqid [𐎘𐎖𐎄], has a relative in Hebrew shaked [שקד], by which the tree is referred to in the Bible (see pome­granate).  Many languages of Central Asia and India name almond as badam; for example, the name is the same in Farsi, Kazakh, Marathi and Punjabi [بادام, бадам, बदाम, ਬਦਾਮ], and similar in countless other languages. This is probably an ancient word because it already appears in Pahlavi (Middle Persian) as wadam and in Sanskrit as badama [बादाम] or vatama [वाताम]. Via Turkish badem, that name entered some South-Eastern European tongues, e. g., Albanian bajame and Bulgarian badem [бадем].  The botanic genus name, Prunus, is derived from the Latin name of the closely related plum, prunum, which in turn goes back to Greek proumnon [προῦμνον]. The species name, dulcis sweet is motivated by the kernel’s taste; bitter almonds are considered a variety (var. amara), where Latin amarus means bitter.  Latin  dulcis is the progenitor of most terms for sweet in Romance languages, e. g., French doux, Italian dolce, Portuguese doce and Catalan dolç. Note that the Greek cognates glykys [γλυκύς] and glykeros [γλυκερός], which underlie English licorice, have a differing initial consonant. The Latin form could have evolved by dissimilation of a hypothetical gulcis, but etymological dictionaries usually prefer derivation from an otherwise poorly attested Proto-Indo–European root DL̥KU sweet and postulate assimilation in the Greek words. However, in that case it is difficult to explain Sanskrit gulya [गुल्य] sweet and gula [गुल] sugar, molasses, which was borrowed by Indonesian as gula, which means sugar (particularly palm sugar) and sweetmeat in general.  I suspect that Slavonic terms for sweet (exemplified by Russian sladki [сладкий] or Polish słodki) belong to the same kin, but was not able to verify this. "

    "etymology": "The name vervaine goes back to a Latin noun verbena leafy branch. About the species name, citri­odorus, see lemon myrtle.  The obsolescent species name triphyllus with three leaves refers to the arrangement of the leaves on the stem: At each node, three leaves are formed (Greek treis [τρεῖς] three and phyllon [φύλλον] leaf). The latter derives from an Proto-Indo–European root BʰEL thrive, bloom derivatives of which designate flat objects in many languages (Latin folium, French feuille, English foil). Also, flower (Latin flos, Italian fiore) and bloom (German Blüte, Swedish blomma) and even blood derive from that root.  The genus name Aloysia, now also obsolescent, was given in honour of Maria Luisa Teresa de Parma (1751–1819), wife of king Carlos IV of Spain.  Some foreign names of lemon verbena contain an element referring to Louise, e. g. Spanish hierba luisa herb of Luisa, Slovak alojzia citrónová lemon Luisa, Greek louiza [λουΐζα] and Hebrew luiza [לואיזה]. "

The genus name Alpinia is in memory of an Italian botanist (Prospero Alpina, 1533–1617). The alternative (younger) genus name Languas is based on Malay lengkuas galanga, which as its Indonesian counterpart laos, originates probably from a shorter form of the Chinese name, liang-jiang [良姜] high ginger. The derivation appears more plausible if a Southern Chinese pronunciation of 姜 (Yue geung, Minnan kiang) is taken into account.

    "main-constituents": "The content of essential oil in the seeds  is strongly dependent on storage conditions, but may be as high as 8%. The oil is composed almost exclusively of oxygenated monoterpene derivatives: α-terpineol 45%, myrcene 27%, limonene 8%, menthone 6%, β-phellandrene 3%, 1,8-cineol 2%, sabinene 2% and heptane 2%. (Phytochemistry, 26, 207, 1987) Other sources report 1,8-cineol (20 to 50%), α-terpinylacetate (30%), sabinene, limonene (2 to 14%), linalool (and its acetate), α-terpineol, terpin-4-ol and borneol.  There is a marked influence of extraction method on the composition of the oil: Oil obtained by hydrodestillation is generally richer in α-terpinylacetate and poorer in 1,8-cineol. Also, storage conditions have a strong effect: α-pinene, sabinene and limone are lost in the couse of several weeks to a few months or storage at room temperature. α-terpinylacetate content may even rise during storage, but it may also degrade to p-cymene.  Cardamom seeds contain about 2% of fixed oil dominated by C16 fatty acids (oleic and palmitic acid).           Sterile cardamom plant           A thicket of cardamom   In the seeds of round cardamom from Jawa (A. kepulaga), the content of essential oil is lower (2 to 4%), and the oil contains mainly 1,8 cineol (up to 70%) plus β-pinene (16%); further­more, α-pinene, α-terpineol and humulene were found.

    "origin": "Southern India and Sri Lanka. Indian cardamom is slightly smaller, but more aromatic.  Although India is the largest producer of cardamom, only a small share of the Indian production is exported because of the large domestic demand. The main exporting country is Guatemala, where cardamom cultivation has been introduced to less than a century ago and where all cardamom is grown for export.  There several related plants in genera Amomum, Aframomum and Alpinia, many of which have aromatic seeds; these may appear as cardamom substitute or adulteration, although the flavours of most of them differ markedly from true cardamom. Some of these have a eucalypt-like flavour worth dealing with in their own right (see black cardamom) while others are more pungent and almost peppery (see grains of paradise); yet many of them are quite disagreeable. These wild cardamoms can hardly be used as a substitute for the real thing.           Thai cardamom, Amomum krervanh kanchanapisek.or.th       © Thai Junior Encyclopedia   Two South East Asian species, however, should be men­tioned because their flavour comes very close to true car­damom: Siam car­damom, Amomum krervanh Pierre ex Gagnep. = A. testaceum Ridley (sometimes misspelt Amomum krevanh) is native to peninsular South East Asia. Its small, almost spherical pods are used in the cuisines of Thailand and Cambodia and imitate cardamom’s aroma pretty well. Another species, round cardamom (Jawa cardamom, Amomum compactum Soland. ex Maton = A. kepulaga Sprague & Burkill), from Indonesia also has a good, cardamomy flavour. If cardamom is ever asked for in recipes from the indicated areas, the local varieties are meant; substitution by true cardamom is perfectly possible.

    "etymology": "The spice has identical or at least phoneti­cally similar names in almost all lan­guages of Eu­rope, e. g., Car­damom (German, English), kard­emomme (Nor­wegian, Danish), cardamomo (Italian, Portu­guese, Spanish), kardamon (Polish, Croatian, Bulgarian, Russian [кардамон]) and kard­emumma (Finnish). Yet there is no satis­fying explanation of that name.  Cardamom was known in Ancient Greece as an expensive item of commerce and known as kardamomon [καρδάμωμον] (kardomeia [𐀏𐀅𐀖𐀊] on the Linear B tablets). The name has not satisfying explanation, yet there is a similarity to the second element in the Greek name of cinnamon (kinnamomon [κιννάμωμον]); and there is also the name amomon [ἄμωμον] for an aromatic spice similar to cardamom. To make things worse, an apparently unrelated name kardamon [κάρδαμον] denotes a pungent herb from Persia (probably a type of cress). Modern Greek has inherited that confusion: Both cardamom and cress may be called kardamo [κάρδαμο].  Also Roman sources tell of two similar spices: amomum and car­damomum, both of which were of Eastern origin. Some suspect the two to be identical (or different grades of the same product), but it appears more probable that they were distinct varieties of cardamom. The more expensive kind, cardamomum, is generally assumed to have been identical to what we call cardamom today; amomum, on the other side,  may have been a type similar to black cardamom. Again, no etymology is known for these two names.           Cardamom flower           Cardamom inflorescece www.pioneerherbs.com   In the New Testa­ment (which was largely written in Greek), the name amomon [ἄμωμον] appears in reference to an aromatic plant. This could be derived (and some books state so) from the adjective amomos [ἄμωμος] blameless, without reproach; given, however, that amomos is a regional and poetic form, this seems less probable than (what other books state) the derivation from Aramaic hemama (which I wasn't able to verify).  The modern genus name Elettaria is derived from the local name in a South Asian tongue; cf. Hindi ilaychi [इलायची] and Punjabi ilaichi [ਇਲੈਚੀ] green cardamom; see below for similar names meaning black cardamom. The common source is Sanskrit, where cardamom is called ela [एला] or ellka [एल्ल्का], which is itself a loan from a Dravidian language. From the corresponding Dravidian root, ĒL, all modern names of cardamom in the major Dravidian languages are directly derived, e. g., Kannada elakki [ಏಲಕ್ಕಿ], Telugu yelakulu [యేలకులు], Tamil elakkai [ஏலக்காய்] and Malayalam elakkay [ഏലക്കായ്]. The second element kai means fruit, see mango.  Cookbooks often render the Hindi name as elaichi; yet the native writing एलैची seems to be uncommon at its best in real Hindi documents. There are, however, a few forms with initial E in related North Indian languages, e. g., Gujarati elchi [એલચી]. Some sino–tibetan languages of the Northeast have borrowed the term in the exact form elaichi, e. g. Garo and Manipuri [এলাইচী, ꯑꯦꯂꯥꯏꯆꯤ]. "

On the other hands, it ontains a few percent of sesquiterpenoids (spathulenol, germ­acrene D, β-selinene). The brown colour of the pericarp is attributed to 0.1% antho­cyanines (cyanidin-3-glucosid, cyanidin-3,5-diglucosid); similar compounds make for the red colour of some onion cultivars.

A. subulatum is native to the Eastern Himalayas; the main production regions are Eastern Nepal, India (mostly in the tiny union state Sikkim) and Bhutan. More than 50% of the world’s harvest are produced in India. ",
    "etymology": "For the botanical genus name Amomum and for cardamom, see cardamom. The botanical species name subulatum derives from Latin subula awl, referring probably to the awl-shaped and pointed leaves.          Black Cardamom flower   The Indian names of black card­amom are usually formed from the name of green card­amom with an epi­thet meaning black (Hindi, Punjabi and Gujarati kali ilaichi  [काली इलायची, ਕਾਲੀ ਇਲੈਚੀ, કાળી ઈલાયચી], Mala­yalam karutta elakka [കറുത്ത ഏലക്ക]) or (among the Northern languages) more often big (Hindi and Maithili bari ilaichi [काली इलायची, बऱी इँलाइची], Urdu bari elaichi [بڑی الائچی], Bengali boro elach [বড়ো এলাচ]); cf. also Anglo–Hindi big ilaichi [बिग इलायची]. An outlyer is Marathi masalyachi velchi [मसाल्याची वेलची] spicy cardamom.           Group of Black Cardamom plants with yellow flowers   However, in a few lan­guages, un­marked ilaichi-type names refer to black card­amom; this is parti­cularly common in the Hima­laya (Nepali alainchi [अलैंची]) and among the Naga lan­guages in North Eastern India, where black but not green card­amom grows locally. Also,  Oriya has aleich [ଅଳେଇଚ], which is rather sur­prising as neither card­amom type is native to Orissa. In these cases, the name of green card­amom is usually un­related. Another inter&shy­;esting case is Gujarati, which has regular names kali ilaichi [કાળી ઈલાયચી] black cardamom and badi ilaichi [બડી ઈલાયચી] big cardamom, but also an unmarked name yet etymologically related name, elcha [એલચા], which denotes black cardamom specifically.           Group of Black Cardamom plants with yellow flowers   Rajasthani language, which usu­ally agrees with Hindi in its culi­nary terms, has an in­de­pen­dent name for black card­amom, doda [डोडा]; this prob­ably cor­responds to black card­amom being of excep­tional impor­tance in the cooking of Rajasthan.

In the leaf oil, the aroma is determined by carvone (30 to 40%), limonene (30 to 40%), phellandrene (10 to 20%) and other monoterpenes; dill ether (a monoterpene ether) is characteristic of dill leaf oil.

Most imported dill stems from Egypt, other Mediterranean countries or Eastern Europe.           Dill plants           Young dill umbel  ",
    "etymology": "The name dill is probably related to Old Norse dilla calm, soothe; it has been suggested that dill was used to relieve stomach pain in babies (due to its antiflatulent power) and thereby soothed them. Another theory sees German Dolde umbel as the source of the name. Dill is found, with almost no variation (Dutch dille), in all Germanic languages and has been transferred to some non-Germanic languages, mainly in Northern Europe: Finnish tilli, Estonian till, Latvian dilles and Scottish Gaelic dile.  Most Slavonic tongues share a common name for dill, e. g., Bulgarian kopur [копър], Ukrainian krip [кріп], Russian ukrop [укроп], Slovak kôpor, Polish koper and Czech kopr. These names are explained to derive from a Common Slavonic root KAPR’ dill, which might be related to Lithuanian kvapas smell, aroma and kvepia be fragrant.  The Slavonic names have entered some non-Slavonic tongues as loanwords: Albanian kopër, Hungarian kapor, Lithuanian krapai, Georgian ok’rop’i [ოკროპი] and Yiddish krop [קראָפּ]. The Romanian term mărar probably arose by confusion with fennel, which is called maratho [μάραθο] in Modern Greek.  The botanical genus name Anethum derives from Greek aneson [ἄνησον] or aneton [ἄνητον], which also gave rise to the name of anise; the species name graveolens means strongly smelling (Latin gravis grave, heavy and olens smelling from the verb olere).           Dill umbel   Names in most Romance tongues derive from Latin anethum, e. g. Italian aneto and French aneth. Some Iberic incarnation of that name, perhaps Portuguese endro or a related form like Galician eneldo, has been transferred to several Eastern languages: Sinhala anduru [ඈඳුරු], Malay ender, Japanese inondo [イノンド] and Korean inondu [이논드].  The French name fenouil bâtard bastard fennel and Dutch stinkende vinke stinking fennel are clearly pejorative, but I cannot comment on that further.  German Gurkenkraut cucumber herb, which dill shares with borage, is motivated by the herb’s frequent use in cucumber dishes in German cuisine.

Ad­ditional aroma com­ponents are estragol (iso-anethol, 2%), anise aldehyde  (less than 1%), anise alcohol, p-methoxy-aceto­phenone, pinene, limonene, γ-himachalene (2%). An unusual compound is the phenol ester 4-methoxy-2-(1-propene-yl)-phenol-2-methyl-butyrate, which is characteristic for anise (5%). Older books (e. g., Melchior and Kastner) mention that anise, especially of Italian origin, may contain small amounts of highly toxic hemlock fruits. This warning seems now to be obsolete; you’ll probably not share Sokrates’ fate just after enjoying one anise biscuit. ",
    "origin": "Eastern Medi­terranean (Egypt?) or West Asia. Turkey is still an important producer in our days, but still better qualities come from Spain. In Far Eastern cuisines (India, Iran, Indonesia), no distinction is made between anise and fennel (see below). Therefore, the same name is usually given to both of them. On the Philippines,  star anise is a popular spice and referred to as anise for short.           Anise flowers  ",
    "etymology": "The spice got its an­cient names (Latin anisum from Greek anison [ἄνισον] or anneson [ἄννησον]) by con­fusion with with dill, which in Greek was known as aneton [ἄνητον].  Names of anise in virtually all European languages are derived from Latin anisum, with very little variation: The form anis is valid in a large number of languages, including Norwegian, Croatian, Finnish, Russian (written анис) Ukrainian (written аніс) and Hebrew (written אניס). Examples for names in other languages are Icelandic anís, Latvian anīss, Hungarian ánizs Czech anýz, Polish anyż, Estonian aniis, Italian anice, Romanian anason, Arabic al-yansun [اليانسون], Urdu anisuan [انیسواں] and Farsi anisun [انیسون].  Sanskrit shatapushpa [शतपुष्प] literally means a hundred flowers and probably refers to the flower cluster (umbel).  The Sanskrit name was also applied to related plants, and some modern languages have borrowed the term from Sanskrit in non-compatible meanings. For example, thian-sattapusa [เทียนสัตตบุษย์] is the name of anise fruits in Thai herbal medicine, but Telugu shatapushpamu [శతపుష్పము] and Sinhala shatapushpa [ශතපුෂ්ප] both mean dill.           Anise umbel   The Hindi na­me saunf [सौंफ] pro­per­ly de­notes fennel, which anise is thought to be a foreign variety of and which is often used inter­change­ably with anise. To dis­tin­guish anise clear­ly from fennel, the spe­cial­ized terms patli saunf [पतली सौंफ] thin fennel or vilayati saunf [विलायती सौंफ] foreign fennel may be used.  Some languages name anise as a sweet variant of other, related spices; for example, Indonesian jinten manis and Arabic kamun halu [كمون حلو] both mean sweet cumin, a name which is also sometimes heard in English. Arabic has another, similar name habbu al-hulwa [حبة الحلوة] sweet grains. Portuguese erva doce sweet herb may denote anise, fennel or occasionally other sweet plants like sweetleaf (Stevia rebaudiana).  In regions where anise is less common than star anise, it may be denoted as a smaller or grainy variant of the latter. Examples include Vietnamese hat hoi [hạt hồi] grain-shaped star anise, Farsi badiyan romi [بادیان رومی] Roman star anise (where Rome just stands for the West, or Europe) and Uzbek arpa-bodiyon [арпабодиён] barley-like star anise.

    "main-constitu­ents": "The dried fruits may contain 5 to 8% of essential oil, which domi­nated by anethole (85 to 90%). The other com­ponents, methylchavicol, phell­andrene, linalool, safrole and terpineol, have only small effect on the aroma. Traces of 1,4 cineol can be used to distinguish star anise from anise, which (like most other spices) is free of this compound. ",
    "origin": "Southern China and Vietnam. The plant is not known in the wild state. Most imports come from China, but  the spice is also planted in Laos, on the Philippines and even in Jamaica. ",
    "etymology": "The Chinese names of star anise, Cantonese bat gok and Mandarin ba jiao [八角] both mean eight corners, octagon and allude to the eight-pointed shape of star anise fruits (eight corner spice). In Chinese herbal medicine, star anise is known as ba jiao hui xiang [八角茴香] eight-cornered fennel.  Chinese 大茴香 (pronounced daai wuih heong in Cantonese and da hui xiang in Mandarin) big fennel denotes anise, not star anise. Nevertheless, the same Kanji in Japanese (pronounced daiuikyō [だいういきょう]) mean star anise! Even more surprising, the corresponding Korean name taehoihyang [대회향] usually means star anise, but can also be applied to nigella.  English badian anise and related names in other European tongues (Spanish badián, Latvian badjans, Macedonian badijan [бадијан], and Russian badyan [бадьян]) are derived from the Persian name of star anise, badiyan [بادیان], whose origin is not clearly known to me; yet it might be an adaption of Chinese ba jiao.  English, and probably in other languages also, badian sounds archaic and obsolete; it is found only in historical recipes, not in contemporary cookbooks.  Because of its extreme olfactory similarity to anise, star anise is named after anise in many European countries. Quite often, a name for star anise if formed by combining the local name for anise with an epithet referring to the Asian origin or the characteristic star-like shape, e. g., Turkish çin anason and French anis de la Chine China-Anise and Estonian tähtaniis, Polish anyż gwiazdkowaty and Italian anice stellato, all meaning starlike anise. In the opposite way, European anise is known as hat hoi [hạt hồi] grain-shaped star anise in Vietnam and as badiyan romi [بادیان رومی] Roman star anise in Iran. The Kashmiri name badian [بادیان] rather surprisingly denotes another similar spice, fennel.  The genus name Illicium is derived from Latin illicere allure, probably because of the sweet and attractive fragrance. "

See also licorice for sweet spices. Fruits and leaves of several aromatic plants from the parsley family share their fragrance, which might loosely be called anise-like. This impression is strongest in cicely, but anise as the best known example is only slightly weaker. On the other hand, the fragrance of fennel is slightly less pure. Chervil combines anise fragrance with parsley-like freshness. Remotely similar to anise is dill, whose aroma is nearer to caraway.  Spices with anise flavour are also known from other plant families. The best-known examples are star anise and licorice, furthermore some Thai basil varieties, tarragon and Mexican tarragon. More obscure spices that can be named in this context are Mexican pepper-leaves and some relatives of Sichuan pepper. ",

    "origin": "The plant is of Western European origin. It is a common garden plant in parts of Western Europe, mainly Scandi­navia. ",
    "etymology": "English cicely goes back to the obscure Greek plant name seselis [σέσελις], which was apparently used as a collective term for a number of umbelli­ferous herbs including modern genera Seseli, Tordylium and Bupleurum. German Süßdolde sweet umbel refers to both the sweet taste and the umbel-shaped flower cluster.  The botanical genus name Myrrhis derives from Greek myrrhis [μυρρίς], which denotes both an unidentified plant and an aromatic oil from Western Asia; it is probably related to Greek myron [μύρον] balm (see also nutmeg). The scientific species name odoratus is Latin meaning scented.  Comparisons with chervil suggest themselves (e. g., German Myrrhenkerbel myrrh-chervil). Another common motive is Spanish chervil found in many languages of Western Europe, particularly Scandinavia, e. g., Italian cerfoglio di Spagna and Danish Spansk kørvel; this refers to the suspected Western Mediterranean origin of the plant. Some variation includes Dutch Roomse kervel Roman chervil and quite curiously Finnish saksankirveli German chervil. "

The Korean species Z. schinifolium has aromatic seeds which are preferred for usage, although the pericarp could also be used, as the flavours are the same.  The spice as commercially available very often contains significant amounts of stem material, mostly the very tough and pointed thorns, which can be harmful if swallowed; it’s best to remove them before usage.  In Japan, young leaves of the Sichuan pepper tree are used fresh, both as flavouring and decoration (kinome or konome [木の芽, きのめ, このめ]). ",
    "plant-family": "Rutaceae (citrus family). ",
    "sensory-quality": "The dried fruits of Sichuan pepper and its relatives have an aromatic odour that, for most species, can be described as lemon-like, with more or less pronounced warm and woodsy overtones. Some of the species have deviating flavour, e. g., Z. alatum (spicy) and Z. avicennae and Z. schinifolium both of which have an anise aroma.  The taste of most species is pungent and biting; it may take some time to develop, but in the end produces a strangly numbing, almost anaesthetic feeling on the tongue. Again, Z. schinifolium is an exception because it has only small pungent quality.  Sichuan pepper (Z. piperitum) leaves have a fresh flavour somewhat in between of mint and lime. ",
    "main-constituents": "Most Zanthoxylum species produce pungent alkamides derived prom polyunsaturated carboxylic acids, which are stored in the pericarp (fruit wall, shell) but not in the seeds.  The exact nature of these alkamides may vary from species to species, but common examples are amides of 2E,6Z,8E,10E dodecatetraenoic acid, 2E,6E,8E,10E dodecatetraenoic acid, and 2E,4E,8Z,10E,12Z tetradecapentaenoic acid with isobutyl amin (known as α, β and γ sanshool, respectively) and 2-hydroxy isobutyl amin (hydroxy sanshools), which have been found in several different species of the genus. Total amide content can be as high as 3% (reported in Z. piperitum). Similar alkamides were found in a herb from South America called paracress.           Four types of culinary Sichuan pepper: Upper left Nepali timur (Zanthoxylum alatum), upper right Indonesian andaliman (Z. acanthopodium), lower left Indian tirphal (Z. rhetsa), lower right Chinese jiao (Z. piperitum/simulans) (200 dpi scan).           Zanthoxylum species from Nagaland   Within the ge­nus, a be­wildering collection of further, potentially interesting nonvolatile  con­stituents has been identi­fied: flavonoids, terpene alka­loids, benzo­phenthridine alka­loids, pyrano­quinoline alka­loids, quar­ternary iso­quinoline alka­loids, aporphy­rine alka­loids and several types of lignanes.  The typical flavour of Sichuan peppers is due to es­sential oils which are, as a rule, mostly com­posed from terpenoids, but the exact composition varies considerably among the species, and sometimes even within the species. The following accounts on Zanthoxylum essential oils can only give a coarse overview on that matter.          Zanthoxylum species from Nagaland   The essential oil (up to 4%) of Chinese Si­chuan pepper (labelled as Z. piperi­tum, but could also be Z. simu­lans or other) as sold in Euro­pe con­sists mostly of terpenes: Geraniol, linalool, cineol, citronellal; also di­pentene was found. (Deutsch. Apoth-Zeit., 46, 2381, 1987)  The fruits of the Taiwanese species, Z. simulans, yielded mainly β-myrcene, limonene, 1,8-cineol and (Z)-β-ocimene. The total content of essential oil was reported to be 1.7% (steam distillation) and 6.4% (carbon dioxide extraction). (Journal of Agricultural  and Food Chemistry, 44, 1096, 1996)  The leaves of Z. sansho (Japan, allegedly identical to Z. piperitum) contain mostly monoterpene derivatives (citronellal, citronellol) and unsaturated C6 compounds (e. g., Z-3-hexenal), which contribute to a grassy odour. (Bioscience, Biotechnology and Biochemistry, 61, 491, 1997) In the unripe fruits, the content of essential oil is reported to 0.6%, with β-phellandrene (42%), d-limonene (23%) and β-pinene (11%) being the main components. Terpene alcohols (geranyl acetate, citronellol, α-terpineol) were found in the 1 to 5% range. The young leaves (0.12%) yielded mostly terpene hydrocarbons. (Nippon Nogeikakaku Kaishi, 70,1001, 1996)  The most abundant constituent in the essential oil of Z. acanthopodium (Indonesia) is geranyl acetate (35%); the flavour is, however, dominated by the citrus-scented compounds limonene and citronellal. Further components are β-myrcene, β-ocimene, linalool and E-1-decenal. (H. Wijaya, personal communication) (Food Science and Biotechnology, 11, 680,  2002)           Two Zanthoxylum species used in Korean cooking: left chopi (Z. piperitum), right sancho (Z. schinifolium) (200 dpi scan).   The Korean species Z. schini­folium is parti­cularly inter­esting because it is almost non-pungent, and the essential oil distri­butes evenly between peri­carp and seeds. The essential oil was shown to consist mainly of terpenoids (geraniol, limonene, geranyl acetate, β‑phellandrene, phellandral, myrcene, linalool, α‑pinene), but also nonterpenoid volatiles (p‑isopropyl-2‑cyclohexenone, caproic acid, caprylic acid) and especially phenyl­propanoids (anethole, eugenol, methyl chavicol) have been found. (Han’guk Sikp’um Yongyang Hakhoechi, 11, 493, 1998) (Han’guk Sikp’um Yongyang Hakhoechi, 12, 119, 1999) (Zhongguo Zhongyao Zazhi, 16, 359, 1991)  Z. alatum, a species growing in the Himalayas and figuring prominent in Tibetan and Nepali cooking, is reported to contain mostly linalool (more than 50%), further limonene, methyl cinnamate and cineol. (Flavour and Fragrance Journal, 16, 408, 2001) (Journal of Essential Oil Research, 10, 127, 1998)  Also in the Indian species, Z. rhetsa (syn. Z. limonella), the essential oil (3.7%) has been shown to consist mainly of monoterpene derivatives: Sabinene, limonene, pinenes, para-cymene and terpinenes, furthermore the monoterpene alcohols 4-terpineol and α-terpineol. (Zeitschrift f. Lebensmitteluntersuchung und -forschung A, 206, 228, 1998)          Sichuan pepper trunk with strong thorns   Another work on com­position of the leaf oil found caryo­phyllene oxide (13%), caryo­phyllene (10%), β-copaene (5%) and spathulenol (3%); the same authors report sabinene (66%), α- and β-pinene (each 6%) and terpinen-4-ol (4%) in the seed oil. Al­though the authors actually write seed oil, I suspect that the work refers to the es­sential oil obtained from the pericarp. (Journal of essential oil research, 12, 179, 2000)           Sichuan pepper stem with fruits and prickles © Laila Kolberg           Sichuan pepper trunk with strong thorns  Origin The term Sichuan pepper refers to a spice obtained  form a group of closely related plants of genus Zantho­xylum. In Asia, most represen­tatives of this genus are found in the Himalaya region, furthermore in Central, South, South East and East Asia. American and African Zanthoxylum species have not yet been put to culinary use. The most important species are: Z. piperitum DC = Z. sansho (Central and Eastern China, Japan, Korea), Z. simulans Hance = Z. bungei (China, Taiwan), Z. bungeanum Max. (China), Z. schinifolium Sieb. et Zucc.  (China, Korea), Z. nitidum Roxb (DC) (China, peninsular South East Asia), Z. rhetsa Pierre var. budranga Pier. = Z. limonella (Western North India, peninsular South East Asia), Z. armatum DC = Z. alatum Roxb. (Himalaya, peninsular South East Asia, East Asia), Z. avicennae (Lamk) DC = Z. tidorense (China, peninsular South East Asia, Indonesia) and Z. acanthopodium DC (eastern Himalaya, China, peninsular South East Asia, Sumatra). All species mentioned here have their place in local cuisines and can (excepting Z. schinifolium) mostly be used interchangeably. Literature often gives contradicting information which spice is used where; furthermore, Zanthoxylum is a difficult genus with many different, similar and not well-researched species.           Chinese Sichuan pepper shrub © Laila Kolberg  Etymology Zantho­xylum is a dis­simi­lated or probab­ly simply false modi­fication of Greek xanthon xylon [ξανθὸν ξύλον], yellow wood. Cf. German Gelbholz­baum yellow-wood tree and Polish pieprz żółto­drzew yellow-tree pepper (zółty yellow and drzewo tree; see also juniper for the linguistic affiliation of the latter).  Botanical species names of the species mentioned above are derived either by local names (rhetsa, sansho) or are of Latin/Greek origin: piperitus from Latin piper pepper because of the peppery taste; simulans imitating from simulare imitate for the similarity to other species; alatus winged for the leaves’ shape; nitidus shiny, for the bright leaves; armatus armed, from arma weapon for the mighty thorns; further, acanthopodius thistle-footed for similar reasons from Greek akantha [ἄκανθα] thistle, thorn and pous [πούς] foot; lastly schinifolius because the foliage looks like that of Peruvian Pink Pepper (Schinus molle).  The English name prickly ash refers on one side to the numerous thorns of the plant (which are even commonly found in the dried spice), on the other side to the pinnate leaves, which very much resemble those of ash (Fraxinus excelsior). English ash goes back to  the Indo–European name of this  tree, H₃ES, and is, consequently, found in many Indo–European tongues (Old English æsc, German Esche, Old Norse askr, Lithuanian uosis, Armenian hatseni [հացենի], Russian yasen [ясень]); it must not be confused with its English homonym ash burned material, which derives (via Common Germanic ASKŌ) from an Proto-Indo–European verbal root H₂ES burn and also has relatives in nearly all Indo–European languages: English arid, German Esse chimney, Sanskrit ashani [अशनि] thunderbolt, Latin  ara altar (for fire-worshiping), Greek azaleos [ἀζαλέος] dry,  inflammable.           Sichuan pepper panicle © Laila Kolberg   The North Ameri­can species, Z. ameri­canum, is known as toot­hache tree. Due to the an­aesthetic power of its alkamide con­stituents, the plant is ef­fective in  sup­pressing tooth­ache temporarily if unripe fruits or the wood of young branches are chewed. Another plant rich in alkamides, paracress, has similar names.  The Chinese name of Sichuan pepper is jiao [椒]; to distinguish from other hot spices, the name is often expanded to shan jiao [山椒] mountain pepper, hua jiao [花椒] flower pepper or more rarely qin jiao [秦椒] Chinese pepper and chuan jiao [川椒] Sichuan pepper. While most European tongues name the spice Sichuan-pepper or China-pepper, one sometimes finds loan translations of the first two names, e. g., Hungarian virágbors flower pepper or German Bergpfeffer mountain pepper.  In Western literature, the Chinese name of Sichuan pepper is sometimes given als fagara; in botanical taxonomy, that term denotes a related genus (the name was introduced by Linnaeus in the 17.th century). The word originates from a  variant pronunciation of the logographs 花椒; cf. the Cantonese reading fajiu. Possibly, fagara stems from a related South Chinese dialect, or just goes back to an inaccurate transcription of the Cantonese name.  Similar to English, which often uses the word pepper to denote pungent spices even if they are unrelated to pepper, Chinese often forms compound names with the jiao element for such spices. Thus, chile is la jiao [辣椒] hot Sichuan pepper, long pepper is  chang jiao [長椒] long Sichuan pepper, paprika is tian jiao [甜椒] sweet Sichuan pepper and allspice can be called  gan jiao [甘椒] which also means sweet Sichuan pepper. The most important compound of that type is hu jiao [胡椒] wild pepper, which can also be interpreted as foreign pepper or barbarian’s pepper. which usually means black pepper, but can be applied to Sichuan pepper, too.  That compound name may also appear in the name of pepperlike spices, e. g., hundred flavour wild (black) pepper (bi wei hu jiao [百味胡椒], allspice) or wild (black) pepper from the West (ba xi hu jiao [巴西胡椒], pink pepper which is a spice native to America). Tasmanian pepper is called shan hu jiao [山胡椒] wild (black) pepper of the mountain, probably calqued on the English name mountain pepper (a name used predominantly in Australia for Tasmanian pepper).           Ripening fruits of Nepalese Z. alatum           Ripe fruits of Nepalese Z. alatum   The name of the dish dry-fried lamb with three types of jiao (sanjiao bao yangrou [三椒爆羊肉]) is due to that ambiguity: Green bell peppers (qing jiao [青椒] green pepper) and chiles (la jiao) are quickly fried in a wok and sprinkled with toasted Sichuan pepper (hua jiao).  Chinese shan jiao [山椒] is also the source of Korean sancho [산초]; note, however, that this name refers to a related spice with completely different flavour. The spice corresponding to Chinese jiao is known as chopi [초피] in Korean; this name also shows a syllable derived from jiao.          Ripe fruits of Nepalese Z. alatum   Similarly, Japanese sanshō [山椒, さんしょう, サンショウ] is adapted from Chinese shan jiao [山椒] mountain pepper. It is even spelt alike in Chinese and Japanese if the Japanese Kanji writing system is employed. The Kanji sign 山 means mountain also in Japanese, and like most Kanji, it has two distinct readings: Alone and in mostly natively Japanese words it is spoken yama (kun reading), e. g. archaic yama-kujira [山鯨, やまくじら] wild boar (literally mountain whale) or in seiyō-yama-hakka [西洋山薄荷, せいようやまはっか] which is the Japanese name of lemon balm (literally foreign mountain-mint). Yet in words of Chinese origin one has to apply the on-reading which goes san, e. g. san-kei [山径, さんけい] mountain path or the said name of Sichuan pepper, san-sho. Occasionally, the Kanji reading is totally irregular, e. g., in wasabi [山葵, わさび].  The Chinese term ma [麻] basically means hemp fibre (it can also denote hemp seeds or, by extension, sesame seeds); the sign shows plants (lin [林] trees, forest) drying under a shed (chang [厂] factory, workhouse). Apparently, the narcotic properties of hemp motivated its use for the numbing flavour of Sichuan pepper.

Most names in the contemporary tongues of Western Europe derive from Latin cherifolium, e. g. English chervil, Swedish körvel, Portuguese cerefolho and French cerfeuil.  Northern Europeans often call the plant more precisely as garden chervil (Norwegian hagekjørvel), because it is not indigenous and cannot survive in the wild.  Since chervil is used and known mostly in Western Europe, languages of other countries often have no native term for that herb, but use descriptive terms that relate chervil to a more widely known relative, parsley: Arabic maqdunis faranji [مقدونس فرنجي], Kurdish jafari farangi [جافةریی فةرةنگی], Greek frankomaintanos [φραγκομαϊντανός] and Turkish frenk maydanoz all mean Frankish parsley. Even in English, chervil is sometimes referred to as French parsley.  To learn about the common etymology of faranji and French, see long coriander.  The Azeri language, however, names chervil not as a variety of parsley but rather as mountain coriander,  dağ keşniş. "

    "origin": "Central Europe to Asia; it is not clear, however, whether caraway is truly indigenous to Europe. Today, it is chiefly cultivated in Finland, the Netherlands, Eastern Europe and Germany, furthermore North Africa, particularly Egypt. ",
    "etymology": "The German term for caraway, Kümmel,  derives from Latin cuminum for cumin and was misapplied to the plant popular in Germany. Latin cuminum leads, via Greek kyminon [κύμινον], further back to Semitic forms, e. g., Old Hebrew kammon [כמן].  Some names for caraway in tongues of Europe, especially Northern Europe (where caraway is particularly popular), also relate to Latin cuminum, e. g., Danish kommen, Latvian ķimenes, Estonian köömen, Polish kminek and Bulgarian kim [ким]. Some of these names were transmitted via the German name.  Similarly to Latin cuminum, Greek karon [κάρον] means cumin, not caraway. Its origin is not clear; it derives maybe from the name of a region in Asia Minor (Caria), but may well be a variant of Greek kyminon cumin or belong to the kin of coriander. The word was transferred to Latin as carum with the changed meaning caraway and thus gave rise to number of modern names of caraway, e. g., French carvi, Italian caro, Greek karvi [καρβί] and Norwegian karve.  The English term caraway also belongs to that series: It was probably mediated by Arabic (modern form al-karawya [الكراويا]) from Latin carum. Cf. the Iberic names Portuguese alcaravia and Spanish alcaravea and see also capers on the derivation of the prefix al-, which relates to the Arabic article.           Caraway plant in flower           Ripening caraway fruits   Caraway is a spice mostly loved in Northern, Central and Eastern Europe; languages of other regions often lack a specific name for caraway, but use the name of cumin instead, often with a geo­graphic epithet referring to Germany: Turkish frenk kimyonu Frankish cumin, Italian cumino tedesco (Finnish saksan­kumina) German cumin or Hindi vilayati jeera [विलायती जीरा] foreign cumin.  Hebrew has taken another course by backloaning the German Kümmel via Yiddish as kimmel [קימל], while the original Semitic word for cumin is preserved as kamoon [כמון].  The French name of caraway is carvi, but is little used; frequently, caraway is termed cumin de prés meadow cumin, especially in the North, where is grows wild abundantly. Some French texts even speak of cumin, which in most cases equals English cumin, when caraway is meant — here the reader is challenged to supply the correct context.  Care is also required concerning the Sanskrit name karavi [कारवी], reported to mean caraway by some sources (and suspiciously similar to some European names of caraway); yet other sources translate that word with cumin, dill, fennel, asafetida or even nigella!  The card game Three Card Monte (also known as Find the Lady) is in German named Kümmelblättchen (literally caraway leaflet, where leaf is taken to mean  card); yet this has nothing to do with caraway. Instead, the name derives from the third letter of the Hebrew alphabet, (gimel, ג), in reference to the three cards used for that game (which is more often a fraud to scam those not familiar with it). Hebrew gimel is related to gamma and perhaps also camel. "

    "sensory-quality": "All parts of the plant exhibit the same characteristic aroma; it is strongest in the root. ",
    "main-constituents": "There are three cultivated varieties, which in part differ by their chemism. Var. latifolium (broad-leaved) and var. crispum (curly-leaved) are grown for their leaves, and var. tuber­osum is grown for its root. The essential oils of leaves and root show approximately the same composition. The main components (10–30%) are myristicin, limonene and 1,3,8-p-menthatriene; minor components are mono- and sesquiterpenes. The curly varieties (var. crispum) tend to be richer in myristicin, but contain much less essential oil than var. latifolium (0.01 and 0.04%, respectively). In contrast, the essential oil from the fruits (3–6%) is either dominated by myristicin (60 to 80%; mostly var. tuberosum and var. crispum) or  by apiole (70%; mostly var. latifolium). A third chemical race shows allyl tetramethoxy benzene (55 to 75%), which can also appear in apiol-dominated oils (up to 20%).  Toxic poly-ynes have been found in parsley, though in very low concentrations. Another matter of concern is that the photosensitizing furano-coumarins bergaptene and isoimperatorin have been found in the root. ",
    "origin": "The plant is of South European (probably East Mediterranean) origin and became popular in more Northern latitudes in the Middle Ages, when it was commonly grown in monasteries and Imperial gardens according to the Capitulare de villis (see lovage).           Parsley roots   In our days, two different varieties are grown: Root parsley (var. tuberosum) has a  tender, edible root (used as aromatic vegetable), whereas leaf parsley is  solely cultivated for its leafs, which are chopped and used as a garnish in many European countries; its root is small and tough with a woody texture. ",
    "etymology": "The botanical genus name, Petroselinum, equals the classical Latin name for parsley; it was derived from Greek petroselinon [πετροσέλινον] parsley, which in turn is composed from petros [πέτρος] rock, stone and selinon [σέλινον] celery. Parsley, then, must mean rock celery. Why it was called so is not known to me.  Note that the second part of the name, selinon [σέλινον], is not only translated celery but also wild parsley; it appears that little distinction was made between those two in Greece. The word appears already on Linear-B tablets as selinon [𐀮𐀪𐀜] and has a prominent appearance in the Odysseia, where the herb decorates the shore of the island Ogygia [Ὠγυγία], home of the beautiful nymph Kalypso [Καλυψώ]: leimones iou ede selinou theleon [λειμῶνες ἴου ἠδὲ σελίνου θήλεον] the meadows were full of violet and wild parsley — a strange combination of flowers!  See also poppy on the Homeric epics.           Flowering parsley   The species name crispus crispate evidently was given because of the crispate leave shape. Some cultivars have this tendency much in­creased (curly parsley).  Greek petro­selinon [πετρο­σέλινον] and its Latin adaptation petro­selinum are the source of most names of that herb in modern European tongues, e. g., English parsley, Swedish persilja, Irish Gaelic pearsal, Spanish perejil, Romanian pătrunjel, Latvian pētersīļi, Yiddish petrishke [פּעטרישקע], Estonian petersell, Basque perrexil Serbo-Croatian peršun [першун], and Russian petrushka [петрушка]. Note that Icelandic has the partial translation steinselja stone celery. The name was also transferred to some more distant languages, e. g. Hebrew petrosilia [פטרוזיליה], Tigrinya persemelo [ፐርሰሜሎ], Urdu peter sili [پتر سیلی] and Turkmen petruşka. The most Eastern representatives of that kin are Indonesian peterseli, Japanese paseri [パセリ] and Korean pasulli [파슬리].  Quite surprisingly, Modern Greek has an unrelated name for parsley which shows no relation to the Old Greek name: The herb is known by a number of similar regional names including maidanos [μαϊντανός] and maidano [μαϊντανό]. This name is actually a loan from Turkish, where the parsley is known as maydanoz. It is, however, unclear where the Turkish name comes from: It is often suggested that they borrowed their name from a Greek source, and maydanoz is supposed to refer to an area in Northern Greece known as Macedonia; so the Turkish might have name originally meant Macedonian herb. However, this could as well be folk etymology; there was a similar name already in antiquity, magydaris [μαγύδαρις], which denoted a Syrian wild plant that could be confused with silphion (as Theophrastos remarked). That name might have been transferred to parsley later (in Greek or any other languages, from which the Turks might borrowed it). This latter option appears a lot more likely.  Due to the large extension of the Ottoman Empire, the Turkish name spread to several languages of South Eastern Europe and the Orient: Macedonian majdonos [мајдонос], Bulgarian magdanoz [магданоз], Armenian maghatanos [մաղադանոս], Albanian majdanoz and Arabic al-baqdunis [البقدونس] (Maghrebi Arabic: al-maqdunis [المقدونس]).   The Georgian name mak’idoneli [მაკიდონელი] may be interpreted to support the Macedonian connection referred to two paragraphs earlier, but this name is very uncommon in Georgia; the herb is usually named okhrakushi [ოხრახუში] or more rarely called by its Russian name, petruska [პეტრუშკა]; in informal speech, mtsvanili [მწვანილი] green one is often heard. I never encountered mak’idoneli in Georgia; either it is very regional, or just a dictionary artifact.  Some Central Asian languages have names for parsley which are unrelated to both Greek petroselinon and Turkish maydanoz, but rather form a third group: Azerbaijani cəfəri, Kurdish ja'fari [جةعفةری], Farsi jaafari [جعفری] and possibly also Kazakh zäjaba [зәжаба]. I do not know anything about this group of names.  In countries which have no traditional use for parsley, the herb is often named as a variant of coriander which has similar-shaped leaves that can be used similarly to parsley leaves, e. g. Khmer vanns baraig foreign coriander (literally Frankish coriander) or Vietnamese rau mui tay [rau mùi tây] Western coriander; a similar idea is expressed by Chinese ou qin [欧芹] European celery. Two other names, Thai phakchi farang [ผักชีฝรั่ง], and Chinese yang yuan sui [洋芫荽] both mean Western coriander, but may denote both parsley and another foreign coriander, the long coriander of Mesoamerican origin. The Laotian name of parsley, phaksi falang [ຜັກຊີຝລັ່ງ, appears to follow the same principle, but is rather a false friend: In the Lao language, it means foreign dill.  In the opposite way, coriander is often termed Indian parsley (or similar) in Western countries. In quite the same spirit, the name French parsley is sometimes used for chervil. "

    "main-constituents": "Horseradish root contains approx. 0.6% of glucosinolates; the most abundant of these are sinigrin (0.2%) and gluconasturtiin (0.1%). As soon as intact cells are damaged, these isothiocyanates are enzymatically hydrolyzed to yield allyl isothiocyanate and 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate, respectively. See black mustard for biochemical details.  Further glucosinolates in horseradish are glucobrassicanapin and the indol-derived glucobrassicin (plus some closely related compounds like 4-methoxy glucobrassicin, 4-hydroxy glucobrassicin). On hydrolysis, glucobrassicanapin yields 4-pentenyl isothiocyanate; yet the glucobrassicines have no corresponding stable isothiocyanates. Instead, they hydrolyze to 3-hydroxyindole derivatives and free isothiocyanate ions.  Among the non-volatile constituents, one should mention flavone glycosides (quercetine, kaempferol) and particularly ascorbic acid, which is contained to 06% in horseradish root. ",
    "origin": "The plant is thought to be of Mediterranean or Eastern European origin, and is now widely cultivated in Central and Eastern Europe. It is commonly found wild, this is, escaped from cultivation.           Horseradish flower close-up           Horseradish flower  ",
    "etymology": "German has two different words for horse­radish: Meer­rettich is preferred in the North, while Southern Germans and Austrians usually call the spice Kren, which is hardly understood in the North. Meer­rettich literally means more radish or greater radish, indicating the greater size (or the stronger aroma) of horseradish compared to garden radish (Raphanus sativus).  The similarity of the first element of this name to German Meer sea is purely coincidental. A similar motivation is also found in French: The French name raifort is probably formed from radis fort strong radish.  The Southern German term Kren is a loan from a Slavonic tongue, where cognates of Kren are widespread (Czech křen, Sorbian krěn, Russian khren [хрен], Ukrainian khrin [хрін] and Polish chrzan) and ultimately of unknown  origin. Some other non-Slavonic European languages have also borrowed that name, e. g., French cran, Italian cren, Yiddish khreyn [כרײן], Romanian hrean and Greek chreno [χρένο].  The English name horseradish is allegedly derived by misinterpretation of the German Meerrettich as mare radish (mare being the English term for a female horse, for those of other mother-tongues). On the other side, several English plant names contain an element horse to denote large or strong; if one adopted the theory that horseradish is of the same kind, the name would actually parallel German Meerrettich.             Horseradish inflorescence            Flowering horseradish plant            Flowering horseradish plants   The word radish (or German Ret­tich, or French radis) itself derives from Latin radix root. At the basis lies a Proto-Indo–European­pean root WRED branch, root.  The common element of plant names, -wort, has the same origin; see mugwort for more.  The Northern Germanic names of horseradish (e. g., Danish peberrod, Icelandic piparrót and Swedish pepparrot) mean pepper­root, being composed of the name of black pepper and an element cognate to English root, which is itself related to the former mentioned Latin radix. Finnish piparjuuri has the same meaning (juuri root). Note that in Modern Greek, a comparable name pepper root is used not for horseradish but for ginger. See long pepper for the etymology of pepper. An interesting variaton of that theme is the Uzbek name of horseradish, yerqalampir [ерқалампир], literally earth-paprika.  In Japanese, the horseradish bears names comparing it with the indigenous and popular spice wasabi: seiyō-wasabi [西洋わさび, セイヨウワサビ] Western wasabi and wasabi-daikon [わさびだいこん, ワサビダイコン] radish-wasabi. The similarity between the two spices is also emphasized by the many names of wasabi in Western languages that plainly signify Japanese horseradish  The origin of the botanical genus name Armoracia, which has been in use by European botanists for horseradish since the Middle Age, is dark; connections to the Celtic tribe of Armoricans have sometimes be claimed, but it is not easy to find a historic connection. The old genus name Cochlearia (scurvygrass) derives from the Classical Latin cochleare spoon, which has survived in medical terminology to this day. The reference seems to point at the leaves of some scurvygrass species, which are supposed to look similar to the special type of spoons used to administer medicines. The word is closely related to Latin cochlea snail’s shell suggesting that the Romans used shells as spoons.  Cf. also Old Greek kochlias [κοχλίας] snail.  The botanical species name rusticanus rural, belonging to rus country-side, probably refers to the distribution of horseradish. The obsolete species name lapathifolius sorrel-leaved hints at the similar leaf shapes of horseradish and some large-leaved sorrel variants (e. g., Rumex patientia), which were known in Old Greek as lapathos [λάπαθος].

The traditional type vaguely reminds of lemon, and the more recently bred type (camphor southernwood) has an even more intense and dominant smell.

    "main-constituents-": "Southern­wood contains up to 1.4% essential oil. There are chemotypes whose oil is dominated by either thujone (up to 70%) or 1,8-cineol (up to 60%). Minor components are fenchene, sabinene, α-caryo­phyllene and β-caryo­phyllene. Further­more, oil of southern­wood is charac­terized by the hetero­cyclic sesqi­terpenoids davanol, davanone and hydroxy­davanone. See also mugwort on the toxicity of thujone.  Among the non-volatile constituents, an alkaloid abrotin and coumarins (iso­fraxidin, umbelli­feron), flavonoids glycosides (rutin) and free flavonol ethers (various isomeric quercetin dimethyl ethers) are reported. Al­though southern­wood contains bitter sesqui­terpene lactones of absinthin type, it is still less bitter than its close relative, wormwood.  Thujone is also found in southern­wood’s close relatives mugwort and particularly worm­wood, and in unrelated species like thuja or sage. It is rather poisonous and generally held res­pon­sible for the toxi­city of alco­holics con­taining worm­wood extracts. See also mugwort on absinthe. ",
    "origin": "Probably Asia Minor or Europe (the plant today grows wild in the Western Mediterranean).           Flowering branches of camphor-scented (left) and lemon-scented (right) southernwood.           Southernwood young shoot (plant found in Nepal)  ",
    "etymology": "The Latin name of the plant, abrotonum, is not related to Latin aper boar (as might be suggested by the German name Eber­raute, which could be mis­interpreted as boar-rue, but is in  fact a dis­tortion of the Latin name), but was bor­rowed from Greek  habrotonon [ἁβρότονον]; the latter’s origin is not known to me.  English southern­wood is a con­traction of southern worm­wood; indeed, southern­wood can be seen as a Southern (Medi­terranean) variant of worm­wood, which is grown in West and Central Europe only since the Middle Ages (see also lovage). The British name old man also was given in contrast to worm­wood, which is known as old  woman in some parts of Britain. The Estonian name sidrun­puju con­tains sidrun lemon and puju mug­wort; thus, the plant is per­ceived a  lemon-scented variety of  mugwort. For a similar example of a rather controversial fragrance associated with lemon in a North European name, see epazote. French garde-robe Guard of robes refers to the plant’s power to repel moths and other insects; yet lavender is more common for this purpose.  The botanical genus name Artemisia refers to the Greek goddess of hunting, Artemis [Ἄρτεμις]. The classical Greek name artemisia [ἀρτεμισία] is recorded for a plant sacred to the goddess; its precise meaning might have been wormwood (A. absinthium, A. ponticum) or another closely related species.

    "main-constituents": "The  essential oil (0.03 to 0.3%) contains a wealth of different terpenes and terpene derivatives, e. g., 1,8 cineol, camphor, linalool, thujone, 4-terpineole, borneol, α-cardinol and further mono- and sesqui­terpenes. Quantitative and qualitative composition varies strongly with soil, climate, fertilizing, and harvest time.           Roman wormwood, Artemisia pontica www.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de   Thujone, one of the oil’s main con­stituents, is a mono­terpenoid ketone also ap­pearing in sage, thuja and, ac­cording to some sources, in a close rela­tive of mug­wort, southern­wood. It is com­mon­ly hold re­spon­sible for the toxi­city of worm­wood-flavoured alco­holics, parti­cularly absinthe, the drug of the age in France a hundred years ago (Fin de siècle). Absinthe was a potent liqueur  flavoured with anise, fennel, plenty of worm­wood and other plants; it was drunk together with water and sugar. The high alcohol content (often ex­ceeding 60%) and the thujone (typically, 50–100 ppm) both contributed to its psycho-active properties.  Since chronic consume resulted in severe nerve damage, absinthe was banned in nearly all European countries, with the exception of Portugal and Spain. Liqueurs based solely on anise (Pernod, Pastis) could establish them­selves as alter­natives for absinthe.  Within the European Union, the ban was revoked in 1998, and absinthe has become legal again, although the thujone content is now restricted to max. 35 ppm. It is an open question whether the liquor will regain its former popularity.  As wormwood taste intensively bitter, it is almost impossible to incorporate quantities sufficient for thujone poisoning by accident. Even if the thujone is separated from the bitter absinthin by distillation, the resulting product is still too bitter to drink without sugar. Wormwood-flavoured wine (vermouth) contains only traces of thujone. Origin Temperate Europe and Asia. Etymology English mugwort contains an element mu- meaning fly, bug; cf. Greek myia [μυία], Russian mukha [муха] and German Mücke mosquito. The Proto-Indo–European stem, MU-, is obviously onomatopoetic in origin. Folk-etymologically, the first element in mugwort is often assumed to refer to the herb’s use in beer-brewing (mug of beer; see also gale for notes on brewing).           Mugwort plant           Mugwort (flower cluster)   The second ele­ment in mugwort is an old term for plant (Old English wyrt plant, root) found in many other Germanic languages: German Wurzel root (Old High German wurz also had the broader meaning plant), Swedish ört, and Gothic waúrts. Less closely related are Greek  rhadamnos [ῥάδαμνος] branch, Latin radix root and Old Irish fren root, which all derive from a Proto-Indo–European root WRED. For further etymological connections, see horseradish.  Swedish malört moth plant for the closely related wormwood is a similar formation; allegedly,  mugwort’s or wormwood’s smell drives away moths from clothes.  The Modern German name, Beifuß, goes back to Middle High German bībōʒ and Old High German pīpōʒ; it is usually derived from an Old High German verb bōʒen beat, but the connection is unclear; according to one theory  some kind of squeezing the leaves for food preparation is indicated, according  to another, the name refers to some apotropaeic quality of the plant  (it beats or drives away evil powers).  Already in Middle High German, the plant name  bībōʒ got modified towards Fuß foot by folk etymology, as can be inferred from the parallel form bīvuoʒ. This probably relates to an ancient belief, reported by Plinius, that mugwort leaves applied to the feet can make people  run longer and faster.  The various Germanic names of the related plant wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) are not well understood. English wormwood appears to allude to the vermifuge properties of that plant, but this is just folk-etymology: The name can be traced back via Old English vermod to a Common Germanic root wermodaz, which also lies behind German Wermut (Old High German wermuota). Cf. also the name of a wormwood-flavoured wine, vermouth. French armoise amère bitter mugwort refers to the increased bitterness of wormwood compared to mugwort.  The botanic species name of wormwood, absinthium, is indeed the classical Latin name for that plant and derives from Greek apsinthion [ἀψίνθιον] (in the New Testament apsinthos [ἄψινθος]); the word still lives in some Romance tongues: Italian assenzio, Spanish ajenjo, Galician axenxo and Portuguese absinto. It has also spread to some unrelated languages, like Basque axinse and Hebrew absint [האבסינט].           Wormwood flowers           Sterile wormwood shoot   The etymology of Greek apsin­thion is not clearly ex­plained; a theory derives it from a- (nega­tion) + psinthos [ψίνθος], an obscure ad­jective meaning enjoy­able cf. also Sanskrit ashiva [अशिव] unpleasant, pernicious. The meaning of the com­pound, un­pleasant, would seem fit for a bitter herb, but may well be the product of folk etymology. A better guess is that the name actually stems from some Middle Eastern language: In Middle Persian, the name aspand is recorded for a bitter plant (perhaps Syrian rue, Peganum harmala); modern Farsi has afsentin [افسنطین] wormwood and espand [اسپند] Syrian rue. This plant is not related to the herb commonly called rue.  Most Slavonic tongues have similar names for mugwort and its relatives: Polish piołun, Belarusian palyn [палын], Slovak palina, Czech pelyňek, Slovenian and Croatian pelin and also Bulgarian pelin [пелин] (see below for Russian and Ukrainian cognates).  Related names are also found in other geographically close languages, e. g., Albanian, Romanian and Turkish pelin, and Lithuanian pelynas. These names are derived from a Common Slavonic root PAL burn, bright, clear, which itself derives from Proto-Indo–European PEL gray; cf. English pale (of Romance origin) and the native Germanic fallow, and examples from classical languages Latin pallidus and Sanskrit pandu [पांडु] pale. The semantic connection is not clear: It has been suggested to relate the name either to the light gray foliage of wormwood or to its burning bitter taste. See below for another possible explanation of these names.  Explanation of the pelin-type names if further complicated by the fact that, although phonetically very similar, these names have in part deviating denotation: Some of them refer primarily to wormwood (or the related Pontic or Roman wormwood, Artemisia pontica) and others to mugwort; yet most have a broader meaning extending to several members of the genus Artemisia. Even within a language, usage may differ regionally depending on what species is most abundant locally.  To denote a single species unambiguously, qualifying adjectives are commonly used, e. g., in Russian: Mugwort polyn obyknovennaya [полынь обыкновенная] common polyn, tarragon polyn estragonnaya [полынь эстрагонная] tarragon-polyn, southernwood polyn lechebnaya [полынь лечебная] healing polyn and wormwood polyn gorkaya [полынь горькая] bitter polyn.           Mugwort with flowers. Note the black stalks.   In some Sla­vonic lan­guages (of the West­ern and Eastern branches), mugwort has another, unrelated name which is said to mean black stalk or dark grass, e. g., Czech černobýl, Ukrainian chornobyl [чорно­биль], and Russian chernobyl [черно­быль]; the latter, however, is less commonly used than polyn discussed above.  See nigella for an explanation of the black part.  In both Russian and in Ukrainian, the same names apply to a city in Northern Ukraine which became famous due to a disastrous accident in a nuclear power plant in 1986.  This has often been linked to a verse of the biblical Revelation about the Third Trumpet, when the angel cast a star into the waters, making them bitter and deadly: kai to onoma tou asteros legetai ho Apsinthos [καὶ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ ἀστέρος λέγεται ὁ Ἄψινθος] and the name of the star is called wormwood. Taking the bitter waters as a metaphor for radioactive pollution, and identifying wormwood with mugwort, one might then interpret the reactor accident as predicted by the Bible.  Actually, wormwood and mugwort, though closely related, are not identical. Rather correctly, Russian and Ukrainian Bible translations render the Greek plant name apsinthos not as chernobyl or chornobyl, but as polyn (Russian imya sej zvezde polyn [имя сей звезде полынь], Ukrainian a jmennya sori tij polyn [а ймення зорі тій полин]). Confused by the inherent ambiguity of that word, some Western journalist have tried to make a case that the herb mentioned in the Bible is indeed the same that is called chernobyl, which actually may be true (for a Russian or Ukrainian Bible translation), because polyn and chernobyl have indeed overlapping denotation.  This is, however, a good example of a question that cannot reasonably be answered using a translated text; fortunately, the Greek original uses an unambiguous term apsinthos that applies only to wormwood (and maybe other pale-leaved, highly bitter relatives like Pontic wormwood), but never to mugwort. Yet chernobyl means mugwort, nothing else.  Yet there is another connection between mugwort and burning which might account for the Slavonic names derived from the root PAL: The Shamanistic moxa practice (also spelt moksha), which originated in Central Asia, but is today also part of East Asian medicine. In that ritual, a Shaman combusts dried herbs for healing purposes. In Chinese medicine, the method is often employed as following: A thin slice of ginger is placed on a suitable acupuncture point, a small portion of the dried herb is layered on top and slowly combusted. Both the heat and the constituents of the herb are supposed to contribute to the healing power. The Japanese term yomogi [蓬, よもぎ] represents mugwort and related Artemisia species; it can also be written 艾, but the latter kanji more often means the moxa method proper (Japanese mogusa [艾, もぐさ]).

    "origin": "Temperate Europe and Asia. ",
    "etymology": "English mugwort contains an element mu- meaning fly, bug; cf. Greek myia [μυία], Russian mukha [муха] and German Mücke mosquito. The Proto-Indo–European stem, MU-, is obviously onomatopoetic in origin. Folk-etymologically, the first element in mugwort is often assumed to refer to the herb’s use in beer-brewing (mug of beer; see also gale for notes on brewing).           Mugwort plant           Mugwort (flower cluster)   The second ele­ment in mugwort is an old term for plant (Old English wyrt plant, root) found in many other Germanic languages: German Wurzel root (Old High German wurz also had the broader meaning plant), Swedish ört, and Gothic waúrts. Less closely related are Greek  rhadamnos [ῥάδαμνος] branch, Latin radix root and Old Irish fren root, which all derive from a Proto-Indo–European root WRED. For further etymological connections, see horseradish.  Swedish malört moth plant for the closely related wormwood is a similar formation; allegedly,  mugwort’s or wormwood’s smell drives away moths from clothes.  The Modern German name, Beifuß, goes back to Middle High German bībōʒ and Old High German pīpōʒ; it is usually derived from an Old High German verb bōʒen beat, but the connection is unclear; according to one theory  some kind of squeezing the leaves for food preparation is indicated, according  to another, the name refers to some apotropaeic quality of the plant  (it beats or drives away evil powers).  Already in Middle High German, the plant name  bībōʒ got modified towards Fuß foot by folk etymology, as can be inferred from the parallel form bīvuoʒ. This probably relates to an ancient belief, reported by Plinius, that mugwort leaves applied to the feet can make people  run longer and faster.  The various Germanic names of the related plant wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) are not well understood. English wormwood appears to allude to the vermifuge properties of that plant, but this is just folk-etymology: The name can be traced back via Old English vermod to a Common Germanic root wermodaz, which also lies behind German Wermut (Old High German wermuota). Cf. also the name of a wormwood-flavoured wine, vermouth. French armoise amère bitter mugwort refers to the increased bitterness of wormwood compared to mugwort.  The botanic species name of wormwood, absinthium, is indeed the classical Latin name for that plant and derives from Greek apsinthion [ἀψίνθιον] (in the New Testament apsinthos [ἄψινθος]); the word still lives in some Romance tongues: Italian assenzio, Spanish ajenjo, Galician axenxo and Portuguese absinto. It has also spread to some unrelated languages, like Basque axinse and Hebrew absint [האבסינט].           Wormwood flowers           Sterile wormwood shoot   The etymology of Greek apsin­thion is not clearly ex­plained; a theory derives it from a- (nega­tion) + psinthos [ψίνθος], an obscure ad­jective meaning enjoy­able cf. also Sanskrit ashiva [अशिव] unpleasant, pernicious. The meaning of the com­pound, un­pleasant, would seem fit for a bitter herb, but may well be the product of folk etymology. A better guess is that the name actually stems from some Middle Eastern language: In Middle Persian, the name aspand is recorded for a bitter plant (perhaps Syrian rue, Peganum harmala); modern Farsi has afsentin [افسنطین] wormwood and espand [اسپند] Syrian rue. This plant is not related to the herb commonly called rue.  Most Slavonic tongues have similar names for mugwort and its relatives: Polish piołun, Belarusian palyn [палын], Slovak palina, Czech pelyňek, Slovenian and Croatian pelin and also Bulgarian pelin [пелин] (see below for Russian and Ukrainian cognates).  Related names are also found in other geographically close languages, e. g., Albanian, Romanian and Turkish pelin, and Lithuanian pelynas. These names are derived from a Common Slavonic root PAL burn, bright, clear, which itself derives from Proto-Indo–European PEL gray; cf. English pale (of Romance origin) and the native Germanic fallow, and examples from classical languages Latin pallidus and Sanskrit pandu [पांडु] pale. The semantic connection is not clear: It has been suggested to relate the name either to the light gray foliage of wormwood or to its burning bitter taste. See below for another possible explanation of these names.  Explanation of the pelin-type names if further complicated by the fact that, although phonetically very similar, these names have in part deviating denotation: Some of them refer primarily to wormwood (or the related Pontic or Roman wormwood, Artemisia pontica) and others to mugwort; yet most have a broader meaning extending to several members of the genus Artemisia. Even within a language, usage may differ regionally depending on what species is most abundant locally.  To denote a single species unambiguously, qualifying adjectives are commonly used, e. g., in Russian: Mugwort polyn obyknovennaya [полынь обыкновенная] common polyn, tarragon polyn estragonnaya [полынь эстрагонная] tarragon-polyn, southernwood polyn lechebnaya [полынь лечебная] healing polyn and wormwood polyn gorkaya [полынь горькая] bitter polyn.           Mugwort with flowers. Note the black stalks.   In some Sla­vonic lan­guages (of the West­ern and Eastern branches), mugwort has another, unrelated name which is said to mean black stalk or dark grass, e. g., Czech černobýl, Ukrainian chornobyl [чорно­биль], and Russian chernobyl [черно­быль]; the latter, however, is less commonly used than polyn discussed above.  See nigella for an explanation of the black part.  In both Russian and in Ukrainian, the same names apply to a city in Northern Ukraine which became famous due to a disastrous accident in a nuclear power plant in 1986.  This has often been linked to a verse of the biblical Revelation about the Third Trumpet, when the angel cast a star into the waters, making them bitter and deadly: kai to onoma tou asteros legetai ho Apsinthos [καὶ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ ἀστέρος λέγεται ὁ Ἄψινθος] and the name of the star is called wormwood. Taking the bitter waters as a metaphor for radioactive pollution, and identifying wormwood with mugwort, one might then interpret the reactor accident as predicted by the Bible.  Actually, wormwood and mugwort, though closely related, are not identical. Rather correctly, Russian and Ukrainian Bible translations render the Greek plant name apsinthos not as chernobyl or chornobyl, but as polyn (Russian imya sej zvezde polyn [имя сей звезде полынь], Ukrainian a jmennya sori tij polyn [а ймення зорі тій полин]). Confused by the inherent ambiguity of that word, some Western journalist have tried to make a case that the herb mentioned in the Bible is indeed the same that is called chernobyl, which actually may be true (for a Russian or Ukrainian Bible translation), because polyn and chernobyl have indeed overlapping denotation.  This is, however, a good example of a question that cannot reasonably be answered using a translated text; fortunately, the Greek original uses an unambiguous term apsinthos that applies only to wormwood (and maybe other pale-leaved, highly bitter relatives like Pontic wormwood), but never to mugwort. Yet chernobyl means mugwort, nothing else.  Yet there is another connection between mugwort and burning which might account for the Slavonic names derived from the root PAL: The Shamanistic moxa practice (also spelt moksha), which originated in Central Asia, but is today also part of East Asian medicine. In that ritual, a Shaman combusts dried herbs for healing purposes. In Chinese medicine, the method is often employed as following: A thin slice of ginger is placed on a suitable acupuncture point, a small portion of the dried herb is layered on top and slowly combusted. Both the heat and the constituents of the herb are supposed to contribute to the healing power. The Japanese term yomogi [蓬, よもぎ] represents mugwort and related Artemisia species; it can also be written 艾, but the latter kanji more often means the moxa method proper (Japanese mogusa [艾, もぐさ]). Specific names for particular artemisias are usually formed with the former kanji logograph, e. g., niga-yomogi [苦蓬,  にがよもぎ] bitter yomogi (wormwood) or oo-yomogi  [大蓬,  おおよもぎ] large yomogi  (A. montana). Mugwort also has the more specific name ōshū-yomogi [おうしゅうよもぎ] European yomogi.  For the derivation of the botanical genus name Artemisia, see southernwood.

    "plant-family": "Asteraceae (sunflower family, also known as aster or daisy family), subfamily Asteroidae. ",
    "sensory-quality": "German Tarragon is sweet and aromatic, reminiscent to fennel, anise and licorice (see also cicely). Russian Tarragon, on the contrast, is not at all fragrant and tastes slightly bitter.  Tarragon’s strong and yet subtle flavour differs much from most other anise-flavoured spices. Yet, a plant popular in the USA but hardly known elsewhere, Mexican tarragon, offers an almost perfect imitation of tarragon aroma.           Russian tarragon (sterile)  ",
    "main-constituents": "The so-called German Tarragon (called French Tarragon in all other countries) is the most aromatic cultivar. It contains up to 3% essential oil, whose aroma is dominated by the phenyl­propanoids methyl chavicol (also called estragole, up to 80%) and its isomer anethol (10%). Important terpene components are trans-β‑ocimene (up to 22%), cis-β‑ocimene (up to 15%) and γ‑terpineol (vary variable, up to 17%). Lesser amounts of p‑methoxy cinnam­aldehyde, phell­andrene, α- and β‑pinene, camphene, limonene and eugenol are also reported.  Another cultivar, the so-called  Russian Tarragon (which is closer to the wild form) contains  less essential oil (max. 1%), the main components of which are sabinene (up to 50%), methyl eugenol (up to 30%), elemicin (up to 30%), isoelimicin (up to 20%) and β-ocimene (10%). Since estragole is missing from its oil, Russian Tarragon lacks the sweet scent of German Tarragon; instead, flavonoids (quercetin, patuletin) contribute a harsh and astringent flavour. Unfortunately, the Russian variety is much easier to grow in cool climate; most tarragon plants sold for home gardeners belong to this inferior variety. ",
    "origin": "Central Asia, probably Siberia. It is not known when and by whom the aromatic varieties were first bread, nor when the plant was introduced to Europe. A herb dragantea is mentioned in the Capitulare de villis of Charlemagne, but its identity is not unambiguously clear (see lovage). ",
    "etymology": "In the Middle Ages, tarragon was known as tragonia and tarchon [ταρχων], which is generally believed to be an Arabic loan; in Modern Arabic, the name is at-tarkhun [الطرخون]. The origin of the Arabic name is not clear, but it might be a loan from Old Greek, perhaps akin to  drakon [δράκων] dragon, snake. Apparently, the plant was linked to dragons because of the serpent-shaped rhizome, and there was a wide-spread belief that tarragon could not only ward off serpents and dragons, but could also heal snake bites.           Flowering Russian Tarragon           Russian tarragon   The names of tarragon on modern lan­guages of Europe and Western Asia are mostly derived from the names given in the previous para­graph. Examples include English tar­ragon, Finnish rakuna, Spanish tar­ragona and Hebrew taragon [טרגון]. In French, the name ac­quired an initial E (estragon), which then spread, sup­posedly in the context of French cooking recipes, to many other lan­guages; thus, we find that estragon is a valid name in many the Euro­pean lan­guages, but note the Scandi­navic form esdragon and Russian estragon [эстрагон].  In some languages, the herb has popular names that can be seen as trans­lations of the tarragon/estragon type names into the vernacular: Examples include Dutch slange­kruid snake herb and drake­bloed dragon’s blood, Italian dragon­cella little dragon and French herbe dragonne dragonwort. Cf. also Chinese long hao [龍蒿] dragon-mugwort.  A particularly charming case is Icelandic fáfnis­gras grass of Fafnir, named after an evil dragon in the Eddic poem Fáfnis­mál, who is slain by the hero Sigurth (Poetic Edda). Could one then, in skaldic tradition, refer to tarragon as Gnita Heath’s Green?          Russian tarragon   Another group of names might have arisen from Arabic without Greek or Latin inter­mediates, e. g., Turkish tarhun, Georgian t’arkhuna [ტარხუნა], Farsi tarkhun [ترخون], Kurdish tarkhuun [تةرخوون] and, via Turkish, Romanian tarhon, Serbian tarkanj [таркањ] and Hungarian tárkony.  For the genus name Artemisia, see southernwood. The species name dracunculus means little dragon (diminutive of draco).  The German name Bertram is sometimes misapplied to tarragon, but should be reserved for Anacyclus pyrethrum (Asteraceae). It is an adaptation of the Greek plant name pyrethron [πύρεθρον], which refers to the hot and pungent taste of the root, or maybe to its antipyretic action (pyr [πῦρ] fire). Compare also Slovenian pehtran. "

The modern Farsi name angozad [انگژد] or anguze [انگوژه] derives from ang [انگ] gum; sap and zad [ژد] resin. The first element ang is also found in the names of asafetida in many Indic languages, e. g., Hindi hing [हींग] or Dhivehi hungu [ހުނގު], but I do not know its origin; the second relates distantly to bitumen, cud and German Kitt putty, deriving from Proto-Indo–European GʷET resin; cf. Sanskrit jatu [जतु] gum, bitumen.  Some very picturesque names (German Teufelsdreck, French merde du diable, Czech čertovo lejno, Swedish dyvelsträck and Turkish şeytan tersi), all meaning more or less politely dung of devil, exemplify the small enthusiasm this unusual spice meets outside the regions of its traditional usage. Latvian drīveldriķis is an obsolete pharmaceutical term probably derived from a Northern Germanic language; there is also a Latvian calque velna sūds devil’s shit. A similar motive is represented by Hungarian ördöggyökér satan’s root and Finnish pirunpihka devil’s gum. "

The monoterpenes dominate by mass, but the sesquiterpenes are important for the characteristic flavour.  The pungency is caused by the lignane cubebin (2%) and several related compounds: hinokinin, clusin, dihydroclusin, dihydrocubebin and more. Amides, which are the pungent principles in black and long pepper, do not play a significant rôle in cubeb pepper. (Phytochemistry, 24, 329, 1985).

    "origin": "Indonesia. Most cubeb pepper is today harvested in Jawa and other Indonesian islands, but also from some African countries (Sierra Leone, Congo), cubeb pepper is exported. The so-called false cubeb pepper stems from the Central African species Piper guineense (syn. P. clusii). Its fruits, also known as ashanti pepper, indeed strongly resemble cubeb berries, but are prolate-elliptically shaped, smaller, smoother in surface and somewhat reddish coloured. Their fruit stalk (tail) is, contrasting cubeb pepper, not straight but curved. Ashanti pepper tastes similar to cubeb pepper, but fresher and less bitter. ",
    "etymology": "The word cubeb entered European languages via Arabic al-kabaabah [الكبابة or الكبابه], which, however, is of unknown origin.  Quite confusingly, Indian names of the type kabab chini (Chinese cubebs) may refer either to cubeb pepper or allspice; I guess this is because the two spices look similar and have no tradition in India, and therefore get easily mixed up.

Besides safrol, two more phenyl­propanoids (eugenol methylester, 5-methoxy eugenol) and terpenoids (camphor) are reported.  Safrol (older form safrole) occurs as a minor or trace component in many essential oils (e. g., star anise, nutmeg and even black pepper). It is the main aroma component of an exotic Mesoamerican spice, Mexican pepper-leaves. Despite its pleasant fragrance, safrole has proved to be a potent hepatotoxin and hepato­cancerogen in animals. Because of low safrol content of sassafras leaves and particularly filè powder, these products are generally believed harmless in the culinary scale; yet culinary or medical usage of sassafras roots (which is much higher in safrol) is strongly discouraged.

    "origin": "The species Piper longum is of South Asian origin (Deccan peninsular), whereas the closely related Piper retrofractum comes from South East Asia and is mostly cultivated in Indonesia and Thailand. Both species are often not clearly distinguished in the spice trade. ",
    "etymology": "Pepper and related words names in most other European tongues ultimately derive from the Sanskrit name of long pepper, pippali [पिप्पलि, पिप्पली] Long pepper reached Europe earlier than the now much more important black pepper, and thus the latter inherited the name of the former.  There is no known etymology for Sanskrit pippali, the word clearly being of non-Indo–European origin. Note that pippala [पिप्पल] is the Sanskrit names of the sacred fig (Ficus religiosa) which figures prominently in Buddhism because Siddharta Gautama got enlighted while sitting in the shadow of such a tree. That name occurs already in the early Rigveda and has been tentatively categorized as neither Indo–European nor Dravidian nor Munda, but belonging to an ancient, now extinct language  X of Northern India that is visible only through some loan words in later tongues.  The first Europeans enjoying pepper were the Greeks. They called the spice peperi [πέπερι], which is pretty close to the original Sanskrit word. When the dominion of the Mediterranean passed from the Greeks to the Romans, the latter also inherited the former’s rôle as main pepper consumers. In fact, late Roman cuisine depended heavily  on Eastern spices in general, and both long and black pepper in particular (see also silphion). In Latin, pepper was called piper, still today the botanical genus name.           Ripe South East Asian long pepper fruits (P. retrofractum) kanchanapisek.or.th       © Thai Junior Encyclopedia   Latin piper is pro­genitor of almost all names of pepper in con­temporary Euro­pean lan­guages. See black pepper for more infor­mation.  Since words derived from Latin piper signify black pepper in all modern European languages, names of long pepper are usually formed with an adjective long, e. g., Turkish uzun biber, Russian dlinnyj perets [длинный перец], Swedish långpeppar and French poivre long, all meaning plainly long pepper; cf. also Slovak dlhé korenie long spice, Chinese chang jiao [長椒] long (Sichuan) pepper and Greek makropipero [μακροπίπερο] large pepper.  Some Indic tongues have, however, preserved two different words for long and black pepper. For example, in Urdu, long pepper is called pipul [پیپل], whereas black pepper may be called with an Arabic loanword, filfil [فلفل]. Of course, both pipul and filfil ultimately derive from the same Sanskrit name, pippali. Black pepper has more names in Urdu, which are formed from another Aryan root; see black pepper for details. Another example is Marathi pimpali [पिंपळी] long pepper vs. mire [मिरे] black pepper; a similar pair exists in Gujarati: pipari [પીપરી] vs. mari [મરી].  Old European sources often had troubles to distinguish long pepper from chiles, both of which are pungent and have an elongated shape. The name long pepper was used for both spices in the 16.th century. Apparently, in modern Farsi, the name dar felfel [دار فلفل] woody pepper may still denote either of the two, although it seems more fitting for long pepper than for chile. "

That name is akin to Latin mel honey and also the British term for orange rind jelly, marmalade.  Similar associations referring to bees are found in several European languages, e. g., Yiddish honik-melise [האָניק־מעליסע] honey-balm, Dutch bijenkruid bee herb or Hungarian méhfű (also mézfű) bee grass. Cf. also Chinese xiang feng cao [香蜂草] fragrant bee plant and English bee balm for the related plant bergamot, Monarda didyma.  Also the Bulgarian name matochina [маточина] refers to the bee feeding quality of lemon balm: Bulgarian matitsa [матица] bee queen, derived from Common Slavonic MAT’ mother (in modern Bulgarian majka [майка]). Similar remarks apply to Czech meduňka, Slovak medovka, Serbo-Croatian matičnjak [матичњак] and related forms. Another Bulgarian name of lemon balm, pcheliak [пчеляк], is directly derived from pchela [пчела] bee (from the Proto-Indo–European noun bʰei-, which also gives English bee).  Because of the prominent lemon fragrance, many names of balm contain an element referring to that citrus fruit. Often, this element is optional with emphasizing character, as in German Zitronenmelisse (actually, Melisse is the same plant); yet in other cases the lemon element is essential in the name, which then often translates to lemon plant or similar, e. g., Portuguese erva-cidreira, Hungarian citromfű, Italian erba limona and Dutch citroenkruid lemon-herb; in the same spirit, there are Ukrainian lymonna trava [лимонна трава] lemon-grass and Arabic raihan al-limun [ريحان الليمون] lemon-basil (or lemon-fragrance, see basil). See lemon and lime for the etymologies of the names of lemon mentioned here.           Lemon balm flowering plant   The Spanish name of lemon balm, toronjil, appears to be related to Arabic turijan [تريجان] lemon balm but I don’t know any details. Perhaps, it is related to Arabic utruj [أترج] and its Hebrew cognate etrog [אתרוג] citron. Note, however, that Spanish toronjil morado purple lemon balm, refers to Agastache mexicana, another herb of the same plant family which has a superb lemon fragrance. The latter plant is in English often termed Mexican Giant Hyssop or Lemon Hyssop, although it is no more related to hyssop than to lemon balm.  Swedish hjärtansfröjd heat’s delight probably refers less to balm’s pleasant fragrance, but more to the usage of lemon balm against  nervous heart diseases in folk medicine. The same holds true for the analogous German local name Herztrost.  In Japanese, lemon balm is known as seiyō-yama-hakka [西洋山薄荷, せいようやまはっか]. This formidable compound can be broken down to hakka mint which is augmented by the element yama (see also Sichuan pepper for the readings of the Kanji 山).  Thus, we get the compound name yamahakka (literally mountain mint) which denotes the native plant spurflower (Rabdosia inflexa). The second prefix seiyō means foreign. Incidentally, seiyō-hakka is the Japanese name of English-type peppermint.  The genus name of bergamot, Monarda, was given in honour of Nicholas Monardus, a Spanish botanist (1493–1588). "

    "note": "Indian and South-East Asian  names for the so-called sacred basil are marked with an asterisk in the list above. This cultivar (Ocimum sanctum = O. tenuiflorum) is characterized by an intensive sweet-camphoraceous fragrance; in India, it is not much used as a culinary herb (although there are scattered reports of such usage), but has a strong religious meaning, being sacred to Vishnu [विष्णु] and symbolizing either his wife Lakshmi [लक्ष्मी] or the wives of his various avatars. It is also planted inside of Shiva temples [शिव], and many Hindus have a plant at the entry to their home, because of the herb’s auspicious connection with Lakhsmi, the goddess of riches and good luck.             Leaves of several different basil varieties: From left to right Mediterranean (sweet) basil, African Blue, lemon basil (O. americanum), spice basil, Thai basil (Siam Queen) and tree basil (O. gratissimum), upper and lower sides.

    "used-plant-part": "Leaves; frequently, the entire herb (all aerial parts) is harvested. Best harvesting season is before flowering. Basil leaves should always be used fresh, as they lose most of their flavour within a few weeks after drying. However, in the Georgian spice mixture khmeli-suneli [ხმელი-სუნელი], dried basil is employed (see blue fenugreek).  The seeds of basil have some use as thickening agent in Thailand. In their outmost layer, they contain mucous substance that, on absorbing water, developes into a thick slime surface with an intriguing, opalescent blueish hue. While these basil seeds lack any taste or fragrance of their own, they contribute an interesting texture, both soft and (by value of the core) crunchy. They are often employed in liquid sweets or sweet drinks.          Mexican spice basil flower  ",
    "plant-family": "Lamiaceae (mint family). ",
    "sensory-qual­ity": "Fresh basil leaves have a strong and character­istic aroma, not comparable to any other spice, although there is a hint of cloves trace­able.  In addition to the Medi­terra­nean type most common in the West, there is a plethora of other varieties or cultivars with different flavour, many of which are hybrids.  India has its Sacred Basil (O. sanctum = O. tenui­florum) with intensive, somewhat pungent smell; in Thailand, there is another sweet basil with a great licorice aroma (see also cicely). Varieties sold to gardeners in the West include cinnamon basil, camphor basil, anise basil and Mexican spice basil; the latter has a very pleasant, complex and warm flavour, with a wonderful sweet note more reminiscent to cinnamon than to anise; I have found basil of this type sold fresh on Georgian markets, to be used as a garnish.           African Blue Basil           African Blue Basil (O. kilimandscharicum × O. basilicum)   A last group of culti­vars is charac­terized by citrus odour: Thai lemon basil (O. citri­odorum) has a distinct balm-like flavour, and then there are lime basil and another lemon basil (O. ameri­canum) which has an ex­tra­or­di­nari­ly pure and fresh lemon aroma (see also lemon myrtle on lemon fragrance in general).  Perennial basil species from Africa (Ocimum kilimandschari­cum) and Asia (Ocimum canum) have recently been intro­duced to the Euro­pean herb and gar­dening market. These species has a strong, but less pleasant flavour; hybrids between them and Medi­terranean basil are a recent in­novation, with novel appear­ance and flavour, and enjoy growing popu­larity.  In English language, the com­mon basil grown in Italy and other Medi­terranean countries is often termed sweet basil; this is, though, mis­leading, because Thai basil has much more of a sweet quality. Thus, I will avoid this term and speak of Medi­terranean type and Thai type instead.          Flowers of Indian Sacred Basil   All basil va­rieties have in common that their dried leaves are much less aromatic than fresh ones;  deep-freezing the herb is the best method of pre­servation.          African Blue Basil (O. kilimandscharicum × O. basilicum)   Main constitu­ents The essential oil (less than 1%) is of complex and variable com­position. Within the species, several dif­ferent chemical races exist, and further­more climate, soil and time of harvest influence not only the amount but also the composition of the essential oil. The most important aroma components are 1,8 cineol, linalool, citral, methyl chavicol (estragole), eugenol and methyl cinnamate, although not necessarily in this order; typically, one or two of those dominate the oil, but hardly any basil contains all of these com­pounds in significant amounts. African species often contain camphor. Some species are characterized by compounds outside of the mentioned spectrum, e. g. thymol.             Flowers of Indian Sacred Basil            Indian Sacred Basil (tulasi [तुलसी])            Wild form of Indian Sacred Basil            Flowers of Indian Sacred Basil   Further mono­terpenes (ocimene, geraniol, camphor), sesqui­terpenes (bisabolene, caryo­phyllene) and phenyl­propanoids (methyl eugenol) can be present in varying amounts and strongly influence the flavour. There is con­siderable infra- and intra­specific vari­ation, opening favourable per­spectives for future plant breeding by selection. Prospects are enhanced by the fact that basil species hybridize easily.            Indian Sacred Basil (tulasi [तुलसी])            Wild form of Indian Sacred Basil    The quality tra­ded in Europe, Western Asia and North America (Medi­terra­nean type, also known as French or Euro­pean Basil) is charac­terized by 1,8 cineol and linalool, plus smaller amounts of estragole and eugenol. This de­scription holds also for both green-leaved and red-leaved (antho­cyanin con­taining) strains. Eastern Euro­pean cultivars contain slightly more eugenol.          Sacred Thai Basil (kaprao [กะเพรา])   Indian Sacred Basil (O.  sanctum = O.  tenui­florum, called tulsi [तुलसी] in Hindi) owes its stronger, somewhat pungent taste to a sesqui­terpenoid, β-caryo­phyllene, and a phenyl­propanoid, methyl eugenol (both around 30%) plus minor amounts of methyl­chavicol (10%). The Sacred Basil of Thailand (ka prao) was found to also contain β-caryophyllene besides a phenyl­propanoid, eugenol and a sesquiterpene, β-elemene. Chemotypes centering on eugenol alone are rare; their odour closely resembles cloves or allspice (see below about O.  gratissimum).           Sacred Thai Basil (kaprao [กะเพรา])           Sacred Thai Basil flower           Sweet Thai basil (horapha [โหระพา])   A couple of chemo­types are domi­nated by estragol (methyl chavicol); these stand apart by their sweet anise or licorice fragrance (anise basil, sweet Thai basil). Also in this group belongs the New Guinea basil, an attrac­tive per­ennial plant with red leaves and an inten­sive fra­grance; its botan­ical affili­ations are unclear.          Sacred Thai Basil flower   Lemon‑scented varieties (Ocimum americanum, O. citri­odorum) contain mostly citral, a mixture of the two mono­terpenoid aldehydes neral and geranial.  The African species, O. kili­mandschari­cum (often known as camphor basil), is characterized by much camphor besides 1,8 cineol; camphor is also found, albeit in lesser quantities, in kili­mandschari­cum hybrids with O. basilicum (e. g., African Blue).          Tree basil (O. gratissimum)   Lastly, cinnamon basil owes its scent to a chemical also found in cin­namon and cassia, methyl cin­namate. A most pleasantly scented cultivar called Mexican spice basil was found to contain methyl cin­namate, β-bisa­bolene, 1,8 cineol and estragole. Litera­ture de­scribed both cultivars as be­longing to the species O. basilicum, and I strongly suspect they are synonymous.           Tree basil (O. gratissimum)           Flowers of the East Indian  Tree Basil (O. gratissimum)           Flower of East Indian Tree basil   The wild species Ocimum gratis­simum (East Indian tree basil, also known as clove basil), growing in tropical Africa and Asia, appears to have a very complex chemism of its own. At least six chemo­types are known, named after their impact respctive com­pounds: eugenol, thymol, citral, ethyl cin­namate, geraniol and linalool. The most common variety sold to Euro­pean gardeners is very rich in eugenol, but contains also some thymol that makes for an attractive spicy, pungent flavour. Culinarily, this plant is generally underrated.           Flower of East Indian Tree basil   This collection demonstrates clearly that basil has a remark­ably vari­able secon­dary meta­bolism, as is often found in the mint family: Perilla and mints show a similar genetic di­versi­ty.  For several related herbs like thyme, oregano and sage the com­position of the essential oil is known to depend on climate, soil, genetic strain and season.           Flower of East Indian Tree basil           Wild growing East Indian tree basil (Sri Lanka)   The dark red foliage of some basil varieties is caused by pig­ments of antho­cyanin type, which are com­monly found in reddish leaves. In wild species, red-leaved specimen are quite rare; but this strain can be easily selected and en­hanced by breeding. For the formation of deep red leaves, intensive sun­light is re­quired in any case; if given maxi­mum sun­shine, red-leaved basil varieties may contain up to 200 ppm antho­cyanins in their fresh leaves. See also annatto about vegetable colourants.             Wild basil found in South India            Lemon-scented Indian wild basil            Wild growing East Indian tree basil (Sri Lanka)  Origin Genus Oci­mum is wide­spread over Asia, Africa and Central and Southern America; it ap­pears to have its center of di­versi­ty in Africa. Most species pre­fer tropical climate .  The culinary herb basil (O. basilicum) is a sun loving plant of the Medi­terranean region; its origin is, how­ever, not known. It was usually assumed to originate from India, as there some of its close relatives grow wildly; however, as it is attested in the Medi­terranean since 3000 years (Egypt), some doubt may be raised. Newer literature openly speculates whether basil could be a native of West Asia. Today, basil is cultivated in many Asian and Medi­terranean countries; main exporters (for the Euro­pean market) are France, Italy, Morocco and Egypt. There is also signi­ficant basil production in California.          Lemon-scented Indian wild basil   The Sacred Basil (or Holy Basil) of India (O. tenui­florum) also has a long history of culti­vation, being de­scribed in the Indic Vedas, roughly 3000 years ago. In the wild state, it is found in tro­pical Asia and Africa; mostly, an origin in India is assumed.  The species known as East-Indian tree basil (O. gratissimum) also has a distribution over  Africa and Asia, but in that case, the higher diversity makes it likely that the species originated in Africa.           Basil Wild Purple, a red-leaved variety (O. canum × O. basilicum) © Sabine Amtsberg           Purple-leaved basil flowers           Anthocyan containing basil cultivar Ruby  Etymology The name basil is derived from Greek basileus [βασιλεύς] king, because of the royal fra­grance of this herb. The names of basil in almost all Euro­pean lan­guages are related, al­though they show some vowel variation: Icelandic basilíka, Belarusian bazylik [базылік], Serbo­croatian bosiljak [босиљак], Albanian bozilok, Czech bazalka, Hungarian bazsalikom, Romanian busuioc, Provençal baseli, Basque brasilla and Modern Greek vasilikos [βασιλικός]. In the era of colonialism, that name was also transferred to a few African languages, e. g., Ewe bebusui and Amharic besobila [በሶቢለ].  The Greek word basileus [βασιλεύς] king means essen­tially people’s leader. The first element derives from bainein [βαίνειν] go, which quite surpris­ingly is cognate to English come and the syn­onymous Latin venire, the common Proto-Indo–European verbal root being GʷEM. The connection is made more obvious if we consider the Mycenaean Greek form of gwasileus [𐀣𐀯𐀩𐀄] lord. The second element is laos [λαός] people, which has no cognates in Modern English, for Old English  leod has been aban­doned in favour of Ro­mance people; related are  German Leute, Old French liode, Lithua­nian liaudis and Rus­sian lyudi [люди]  people and Latin liber free man (Proto-Indo–European root LEUDʰ grow upwards).          Anthocyan containing basil cultivar Ruby   Names like Italian erba reale and French herbe royal royal herb, or German Königs­kraut and Dutch konings­kruid king’s herb are probably calqued from the Greek name. Despite its independent origin, the Quenya name asea aranion [ ] bears the same as­socia­tion: aran [] king.  Iberic names of basil (Spanish albahaca, Portuguese alfavaca and Catalan alfàbrega, also Basque albaraka) are Arabic loans, as might be inferred from the prefix al-. The original Arabic form is al-habaqa [الحبق] the basil; cf. also Maltese ħabaq and Aramaic hauk [ܚܘܟ], and see caper for more examples of Arabic vocabulary in Spanish and Portuguese.           African wild basil O. canum           Wild basil, O. canum pharm1.pharmazie.uni-greifswald.de   In contempo­rary Arabic as spoken in Asia and the Eastern Medi­terra­nean, habaq [حبق] has become rather un­com­mon and mostly sup­planted by ar-raihan [الريحان]. The latter name has close relatives in many lan­guages of the Middle East, e. g., Turkish reyhan, Hebrew rehan [ריחן], Georgian rehani [რეჰანი], Kurdish dhaihan [ذةیحان] and Farsi rihan [ریحان]. Note, however, that Turkish dağ reyhanı mountain basil means savory.  Raihan is derived from Arabic rih [ريح] or riha [ريحة] odour, fra­grance and origi­nally did not mean basil but another aromatic Medi­terra­nean plant, myrtle. This is still so in North African Arabic (and Maltese); moreover, the word has been transferred to medieval Spanish as arrayán myrtle.  The genus name Ocimum is a latinized version of the Greek plant name okimon [ὤκιμον], by which basil is referred to in the work of Dioskurides. It derives from the verb  ozein [ὄζειν] smell (cf. ozone the smelling one, directly from the Greek present participle ozon [ὄζον]) and English odour).           African camphor basil, , O. kilimandscharicum   Indic names for holy basil, e. g., Telugu tulsi­chettu [తుళసిచెట్టు], Tamil tulasi [துளசி] and Hindi tulsi [तुलसी], derive from Sanskrit tulasi [तुलसी]; for the latter name, no satis­fying etymo­logy is known. To distin­guish holy basil more clearly from its wild relatives, com­pound names are used, e. g., Hindi jangli­tulsi [जंगलितुलसी] forest basil to denote O. gratissimum.          African camphor basil, , O. kilimandscharicum   Hindu cult pre­fers red-leaved vari­eties of Sacred Basil; and such strains are often re­ferred to by colour adjec­tives: Urdu kali tulsi [کالی تلسی] or Hindi krishna tulsi [कृष्ण तुलसी] dark/black basil. In Kerala, I have seen O. gratis­simum being called rama­tulasi [രാമതുളസി], which appears to be the un­expected side-effect of a re-inter­pretion of the name of red-leaved Sacred Basil, krishna­tulasi [കൃഷ്ണതുളസി]: The latter was inter­preted to refer not to the colour but to the Hindu god Krishna (the eighth and most famous avatar of Vishnu), and thus the related but dif­ferent green plant got associated with Rama, the seventh avatar. In Nepal, the term ramtulsi [रामतुलसी] may also mean a wild type of oregano.  The Vietnamese name  rau que [rau quế] cinnamon plant (emphasized hung que [húng quế] cinnamon basil) alludes to the sweet–aromatic odour of some cultivars like Thai horapha, although this is more close to anise than to cinnamon. There are indeed cinnamon-flavoured basil varieties, but these are, to my knowledge, not known in Vietnam.

Within the species, several dif­ferent chemical races exist, and further­more climate, soil and time of harvest influence not only the amount but also the composition of the essential oil. The most important aroma components are 1,8 cineol, linalool, citral, methyl chavicol (estragole), eugenol and methyl cinnamate, although not necessarily in this order; typically, one or two of those dominate the oil, but hardly any basil contains all of these com­pounds in significant amounts. African species often contain camphor. Some species are characterized by compounds outside of the mentioned spectrum, e. g. thymol.             Flowers of Indian Sacred Basil            Indian Sacred Basil (tulasi [तुलसी])            Wild form of Indian Sacred Basil            Flowers of Indian Sacred Basil   Further mono­terpenes (ocimene, geraniol, camphor), sesqui­terpenes (bisabolene, caryo­phyllene) and phenyl­propanoids (methyl eugenol) can be present in varying amounts and strongly influence the flavour. There is con­siderable infra- and intra­specific vari­ation, opening favourable per­spectives for future plant breeding by selection. Prospects are enhanced by the fact that basil species hybridize easily.            Indian Sacred Basil (tulasi [तुलसी])            Wild form of Indian Sacred Basil    The quality tra­ded in Europe, Western Asia and North America (Medi­terra­nean type, also known as French or Euro­pean Basil) is charac­terized by 1,8 cineol and linalool, plus smaller amounts of estragole and eugenol. This de­scription holds also for both green-leaved and red-leaved (antho­cyanin con­taining) strains. Eastern Euro­pean cultivars contain slightly more eugenol.          Sacred Thai Basil (kaprao [กะเพรา])   Indian Sacred Basil (O.  sanctum = O.  tenui­florum, called tulsi [तुलसी] in Hindi) owes its stronger, somewhat pungent taste to a sesqui­terpenoid, β-caryo­phyllene, and a phenyl­propanoid, methyl eugenol (both around 30%) plus minor amounts of methyl­chavicol (10%). The Sacred Basil of Thailand (ka prao) was found to also contain β-caryophyllene besides a phenyl­propanoid, eugenol and a sesquiterpene, β-elemene. Chemotypes centering on eugenol alone are rare; their odour closely resembles cloves or allspice (see below about O.  gratissimum).           Sacred Thai Basil (kaprao [กะเพรา])           Sacred Thai Basil flower           Sweet Thai basil (horapha [โหระพา])   A couple of chemo­types are domi­nated by estragol (methyl chavicol); these stand apart by their sweet anise or licorice fragrance (anise basil, sweet Thai basil). Also in this group belongs the New Guinea basil, an attrac­tive per­ennial plant with red leaves and an inten­sive fra­grance; its botan­ical affili­ations are unclear.          Sacred Thai Basil flower   Lemon‑scented varieties (Ocimum americanum, O. citri­odorum) contain mostly citral, a mixture of the two mono­terpenoid aldehydes neral and geranial.  The African species, O. kili­mandschari­cum (often known as camphor basil), is characterized by much camphor besides 1,8 cineol; camphor is also found, albeit in lesser quantities, in kili­mandschari­cum hybrids with O. basilicum (e. g., African Blue).          Tree basil (O. gratissimum)   Lastly, cinnamon basil owes its scent to a chemical also found in cin­namon and cassia, methyl cin­namate. A most pleasantly scented cultivar called Mexican spice basil was found to contain methyl cin­namate, β-bisa­bolene, 1,8 cineol and estragole. Litera­ture de­scribed both cultivars as be­longing to the species O. basilicum, and I strongly suspect they are synonymous.           Tree basil (O. gratissimum)           Flowers of the East Indian  Tree Basil (O. gratissimum)           Flower of East Indian Tree basil   The wild species Ocimum gratis­simum (East Indian tree basil, also known as clove basil), growing in tropical Africa and Asia, appears to have a very complex chemism of its own. At least six chemo­types are known, named after their impact respctive com­pounds: eugenol, thymol, citral, ethyl cin­namate, geraniol and linalool. The most common variety sold to Euro­pean gardeners is very rich in eugenol, but contains also some thymol that makes for an attractive spicy, pungent flavour. Culinarily, this plant is generally underrated.           Flower of East Indian Tree basil   This collection demonstrates clearly that basil has a remark­ably vari­able secon­dary meta­bolism, as is often found in the mint family: Perilla and mints show a similar genetic di­versi­ty.  For several related herbs like thyme, oregano and sage the com­position of the essential oil is known to depend on climate, soil, genetic strain and season.           Flower of East Indian Tree basil           Wild growing East Indian tree basil (Sri Lanka)   The dark red foliage of some basil varieties is caused by pig­ments of antho­cyanin type, which are com­monly found in reddish leaves. In wild species, red-leaved specimen are quite rare; but this strain can be easily selected and en­hanced by breeding. For the formation of deep red leaves, intensive sun­light is re­quired in any case; if given maxi­mum sun­shine, red-leaved basil varieties may contain up to 200 ppm antho­cyanins in their fresh leaves. See also annatto about vegetable colourants.             Wild basil found in South India            Lemon-scented Indian wild basil            Wild growing East Indian tree basil (Sri Lanka)  Origin Genus Oci­mum is wide­spread over Asia, Africa and Central and Southern America; it ap­pears to have its center of di­versi­ty in Africa. Most species pre­fer tropical climate .  The culinary herb basil (O. basilicum) is a sun loving plant of the Medi­terranean region; its origin is, how­ever, not known. It was usually assumed to originate from India, as there some of its close relatives grow wildly; however, as it is attested in the Medi­terranean since 3000 years (Egypt), some doubt may be raised. Newer literature openly speculates whether basil could be a native of West Asia. Today, basil is cultivated in many Asian and Medi­terranean countries; main exporters (for the Euro­pean market) are France, Italy, Morocco and Egypt. There is also signi­ficant basil production in California.          Lemon-scented Indian wild basil   The Sacred Basil (or Holy Basil) of India (O. tenui­florum) also has a long history of culti­vation, being de­scribed in the Indic Vedas, roughly 3000 years ago. In the wild state, it is found in tro­pical Asia and Africa; mostly, an origin in India is assumed.  The species known as East-Indian tree basil (O. gratissimum) also has a distribution over  Africa and Asia, but in that case, the higher diversity makes it likely that the species originated in Africa.           Basil Wild Purple, a red-leaved variety (O. canum × O. basilicum) © Sabine Amtsberg           Purple-leaved basil flowers           Anthocyan containing basil cultivar Ruby  Etymology The name basil is derived from Greek basileus [βασιλεύς] king, because of the royal fra­grance of this herb. The names of basil in almost all Euro­pean lan­guages are related, al­though they show some vowel variation: Icelandic basilíka, Belarusian bazylik [базылік], Serbo­croatian bosiljak [босиљак], Albanian bozilok, Czech bazalka, Hungarian bazsalikom, Romanian busuioc, Provençal baseli, Basque brasilla and Modern Greek vasilikos [βασιλικός]. In the era of colonialism, that name was also transferred to a few African languages, e. g., Ewe bebusui and Amharic besobila [በሶቢለ].  The Greek word basileus [βασιλεύς] king means essen­tially people’s leader. The first element derives from bainein [βαίνειν] go, which quite surpris­ingly is cognate to English come and the syn­onymous Latin venire, the common Proto-Indo–European verbal root being GʷEM. The connection is made more obvious if we consider the Mycenaean Greek form of gwasileus [𐀣𐀯𐀩𐀄] lord. The second element is laos [λαός] people, which has no cognates in Modern English, for Old English  leod has been aban­doned in favour of Ro­mance people; related are  German Leute, Old French liode, Lithua­nian liaudis and Rus­sian lyudi [люди]  people and Latin liber free man (Proto-Indo–European root LEUDʰ grow upwards).          Anthocyan containing basil cultivar Ruby   Names like Italian erba reale and French herbe royal royal herb, or German Königs­kraut and Dutch konings­kruid king’s herb are probably calqued from the Greek name. Despite its independent origin, the Quenya name asea aranion [ ] bears the same as­socia­tion: aran [] king.  Iberic names of basil (Spanish albahaca, Portuguese alfavaca and Catalan alfàbrega, also Basque albaraka) are Arabic loans, as might be inferred from the prefix al-. The original Arabic form is al-habaqa [الحبق] the basil; cf. also Maltese ħabaq and Aramaic hauk [ܚܘܟ], and see caper for more examples of Arabic vocabulary in Spanish and Portuguese.           African wild basil O. canum           Wild basil, O. canum pharm1.pharmazie.uni-greifswald.de   In contempo­rary Arabic as spoken in Asia and the Eastern Medi­terra­nean, habaq [حبق] has become rather un­com­mon and mostly sup­planted by ar-raihan [الريحان]. The latter name has close relatives in many lan­guages of the Middle East, e. g., Turkish reyhan, Hebrew rehan [ריחן], Georgian rehani [რეჰანი], Kurdish dhaihan [ذةیحان] and Farsi rihan [ریحان]. Note, however, that Turkish dağ reyhanı mountain basil means savory.  Raihan is derived from Arabic rih [ريح] or riha [ريحة] odour, fra­grance and origi­nally did not mean basil but another aromatic Medi­terra­nean plant, myrtle. This is still so in North African Arabic (and Maltese); moreover, the word has been transferred to medieval Spanish as arrayán myrtle.  The genus name Ocimum is a latinized version of the Greek plant name okimon [ὤκιμον], by which basil is referred to in the work of Dioskurides. It derives from the verb  ozein [ὄζειν] smell (cf. ozone the smelling one, directly from the Greek present participle ozon [ὄζον]) and English odour).           African camphor basil, , O. kilimandscharicum   Indic names for holy basil, e. g., Telugu tulsi­chettu [తుళసిచెట్టు], Tamil tulasi [துளசி] and Hindi tulsi [तुलसी], derive from Sanskrit tulasi [तुलसी]; for the latter name, no satis­fying etymo­logy is known. To distin­guish holy basil more clearly from its wild relatives, com­pound names are used, e. g., Hindi jangli­tulsi [जंगलितुलसी] forest basil to denote O. gratissimum.          African camphor basil, , O. kilimandscharicum   Hindu cult pre­fers red-leaved vari­eties of Sacred Basil; and such strains are often re­ferred to by colour adjec­tives: Urdu kali tulsi [کالی تلسی] or Hindi krishna tulsi [कृष्ण तुलसी] dark/black basil. In Kerala, I have seen O. gratis­simum being called rama­tulasi [രാമതുളസി], which appears to be the un­expected side-effect of a re-inter­pretion of the name of red-leaved Sacred Basil, krishna­tulasi [കൃഷ്ണതുളസി]: The latter was inter­preted to refer not to the colour but to the Hindu god Krishna (the eighth and most famous avatar of Vishnu), and thus the related but dif­ferent green plant got associated with Rama, the seventh avatar. In Nepal, the term ramtulsi [रामतुलसी] may also mean a wild type of oregano.  The Vietnamese name  rau que [rau quế] cinnamon plant (emphasized hung que [húng quế] cinnamon basil) alludes to the sweet–aromatic odour of some cultivars like Thai horapha, although this is more close to anise than to cinnamon. There are indeed cinnamon-flavoured basil varieties, but these are, to my knowledge, not known in Vietnam.

    "main-constituents": "Perilla leaves contain about 0.2% of an essential oil, which varies widely in composition. Several different chemotypes are known: PA (see below) is the only is the only one of culinary value; the others are PK (main component perilla ketone, minor components isoegomaketone and perillene), EK (main component elsholzia ketone, minor component naginata ketone), PL (main component perillene, minor components citral, perilla ketone, isoegomaketone), PP (phenylpropanoids: myristicin, dillapiol, elemicin, safrole) and C (main component citral, minor components perillene, perilla ketone, isoegomaketone). There is also a type rich in rosefurane, which might have potential as a cheaper substitute for rose oil in perfumery.           Perilla flowering plants   In the most fre­quently culti­vated chemo­type (PA), the main com­ponent is perill­aldehyde  (p-mentha­dien-1,8(9)-al(7), 75%) Its minor con­stituents are limonene (13%), linalool, β-caryo­phyllene, l-menthol, limonene, α-pinene, perillene (2-methyl-5-(3-oxolanyl)-2-pentene) and elemicin. Perill­aldehyde  can cause skin allergies.  The C type is a potentially interesting source of citral, a pleasantly lemon-scented material much used in the flavour and perfume industries; see lemon myrtle for more on lemony flavours and citral.  The PP type may also gain importance as a source of simple phenylpropanoids in the pharmaceutical  industry. The high myristicin content makes this plant considerably toxic (see nutmeg on the hallucinogenic properties of myristicin).  The dominating constituents of the remaining types are monoterpenoid furanes, often ketones. Some of these, e. g., isoegomaketone, are severe pneumotoxins that have caused fatal poisoning in cattle repeatedly. The PK type must be considered a toxic plant that has no use in kitchen.  The oxime of perilla aldehyde  (perillartin) is about 2000 times sweeter than sucrose; it is used as an artificial sweetener in Japan.           Green-leaved Korean type of perilla www.flickr.com   Perilla seeds con­tain a drying oil (40%) with high content of multiply unsaturated fatty acids (60% α-linolenic acid, 15% both linoleic and oleic acid); their medicinal value is sometimes matter of great exaggeration.  Lastly, perilla contains the pseudotannins and antioxidants typical for the mint family; see hyssop for details. The reddish–purple colour of some cultivars is caused by an anthocyanin pigment called perillanin chloride. Origin The plant is native to South East and East Asia. Etymology I was not able to find out anything about the name perilla, although there might be a connection to pearl.  In Korea, where perilla is an important flavouring, the plant is known as tul-kkae [들깨]. This name literally means wild sesame plant, although perilla and sesame are not particularly closely related. Also kkaennip [깻잎] (sesame leaf) is a common designation for perilla in Korean.  I do not know about the motivation behind those weird names; maybe, they refer to the fact that both plants have oil-rich seeds. Occasionally, names of the wild sesame type are found in Korean cookbooks published in English or German. It is to be suspected that the authors meant perilla and not a wild type of sesame.  Also, the Japanese name egoma [荏胡麻, えごま] for perilla seeds is derived from sesame (goma) and means sesame bean.  In some East Asian countries, perilla and rice paddy herb bear confusingly similar names. See there for details.

    "etymology": "I was not able to find out anything about the name perilla, although there might be a connection to pearl.  In Korea, where perilla is an important flavouring, the plant is known as tul-kkae [들깨]. This name literally means wild sesame plant, although perilla and sesame are not particularly closely related. Also kkaennip [깻잎] (sesame leaf) is a common designation for perilla in Korean.  I do not know about the motivation behind those weird names; maybe, they refer to the fact that both plants have oil-rich seeds. Occasionally, names of the wild sesame type are found in Korean cookbooks published in English or German. It is to be suspected that the authors meant perilla and not a wild type of sesame.  Also, the Japanese name egoma [荏胡麻, えごま] for perilla seeds is derived from sesame (goma) and means sesame bean.  In some East Asian countries, perilla and rice paddy herb bear confusingly similar names. See there for details. "

    "sensory-quality": "Strongly aromatic, sweet, warm, but slightly bitter and mucilagi­nous. Compared to Ceylon cinnamon, cassia tastes slightly bitter and astringent, and it lacks the liveliness of cinnamon. On bitter spices, see also zedoary. ",
    "main-constituents": "Similarly to Ceylon cinnamon, cassia contains max. 4% essential oil, 75 to 90% of which are composed by cinnamic aldehyde. There are only traces of eugenol is, but significant amounts (7%) of coumarin; therefore, analysis of eugenol and coumarin discriminates between Ceylon and Chinese cinnamon. Trace components of cassia oil are benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, salicylic acid and the corresponding esters and aldehydes. Cassia bark contains significantly more slime (11%) than Ceylon cinnamon bark. The leaf oil (0.3 to 0.8%) has a similar composition to the bark oil.  In fall 2006, Coumarin has become much-discussed in Germany, as it was revealed that some cassia-flavoured cookies exceed the legal limit of coumarin and might prove dangerous to health. The limit is very low in German law, 2 ppm irrespective of the type of food, which would equal about half a gram of cassia per kilogram if a maximum coumarin content is assumed. Clearly, cassia-flavoured cookies easily lie above this threshold.  In contrast, the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment published an alternative limit of 0.1 mg Coumarin per kg body mass and day, which is considered harmless as average intake. According to this scale, a person of 50 kg could afford to eat 5 mg coumarin or at least one gram of cassia per day. Other possible sources of coumarin, of course, have to enter the calculation separately (e. g., perfumes). See also tonka bean for more on the toxicity of coumarin. ",
    "origin": "Southern China, Burma, Laos, Vietnam. Commercial cultivation is restricted to China and Vietnam. ",
    "etymology": "The name cassia indirectly derives from Greek kasia [κασία], which is probably a loan from Semitic traders (cf. Old Hebrew qetsiiah [קציעה]); its ultimate origin is not fully clear, but the name might well derive, as the spice itself, from China in a larger sense. It was suggested that cassia might be related to the name of the Khasi people, an Austroasiatic tribe in  North-Eastern India (union state Meghalaya) and Bangladesh.  Formerly, they inhabited a larger area in Assam, extending to Burma, and they might have been involved in ancient cassia trade. Another theory links the name to Sumerian gazi [𒃢, 𒃨] (Akkadian kasû), which denoted a spice variously translated as cassia, licorice oder mustard.  For the derivation of cinnamon, Zimt, cimet and similar forms, see Sri Lanka cinnamon; another group of names, exemplified by kaneel and cannelle, has an independent origin discussed under Indonesian cinnamon.  In Central Asia to North India, cinnamon spice was traditionally imported from China. Local languages do not distinguish between Chinese and other types of cinnamon, but employ the same name for all cinnamon types: Bengali darchini [দাড়চিনি], Hindi dal chini [दालचीनी], Punjabi dal chini [ਦਾਲ ਚਿਨੀ], Pashto dol chini [دال چينى] and Farsi darchin [دارچین] (thence Armenian darchin [դարչին]) all mean Chinese wood; see juniper for an explanation of the element dar which means wood. The cinnamon sold and used in today’s India and Central Asia may derive from either variety; furthermore, adulteration by less-quality North Indian Cinnamomum species is common, for example by the bark of the tree that yields Indian bay-leaves.  The name was transferred to a number of unrelated languages: Turkish tarçın, Turkmen dalçyn, Azerbaijani darçın, Kazakh darshin [даршин], Arabic  ad-darsin [الدارسين] and Georgian darichini [დარიჩინი]. In these languages, the speakers are usually not aware of the literal meaning, as the element dar has no connection with wood (in Arabic, it happens to mean country). Also, the association with China is not felt, and often obscured by sound changes or orthography. For example, the Arabic name of China, as-sin [الصين] uses another sound and letter for the S, and in Turkish, the name of China has a different vowel (Çin) because of the vowel harmony imposed on the Persian loanword.

    "origin": "Medi­terranean. ",
    "etymology": "The botanical genus name Carthamus derives from the Arabic verb qurtum [قرطم] dye, in reference to the usage of safflower flowers for textile dyeing. The word also entered some Romance tongues, e. g., Italian cartamo or Catalan càrtam, probably via Spanish cártamo; Turkish kartam, on the other hand, is likely to be a direct loan from Arabic.  The modern Arabic name of safflower, al-usfur [العصفر], comes from an adjective asfar [اصفر] yellow. The same root ṢPR  become yellow also lies behind the name saffron. That name has been trans­ferred into Ottoman Turkish asfur or hasbir, and entered Spanish as alazor according to the medieval Anda­lusian pro­nunciation al-asfur (see also caper on Arabic loans in Iberic tongues).           Safflower           Safflower: Close-up to flower www.inaro.de   Quite amazingly, Arabic usfur is also the source of the name safflower and its cognates in various European languages, e. g., German Saflor, Finnish saflori and Bulgarian and Russian saflor [сафлор]. These names were derived from usfur or asfur via Old Italian asfiore (or saffiore) and Old French saffleur. By folk etymology, the name was transformed towards saffron and flower (Italian fiore, French fleur).  The botanical species name tinctorius is an adjective corresponding to the noun tinctor dyer, cf. the English verb tint. Several European names of safflower contain elements referring to dye or colour, e. g., Swedish färgtistel, Estonian värvisafloor, German Färberdistel and Romanian pintenogă colorantă.  Färber dyer in the German name Färbersaflor is the  nomen agentis to the noun Farbe (cognate to Dutch verf) colour; dye; these words are difficult  to explain etymologi­cally. A Proto-Indo–European root PERḰ coloured,  speckled is often used to denote colourful animals: (Greek perkos [πέρκος] sparrow-hawk, prox [πρόξ] deer, German Forelle trout and perhaps even English perch). It is unclear whether pork (Proto-Indo–European PORḰO young pig) belongs to the same group, as it is more often set into relation with another but homophonous root PERḰ dig (cf. English furrow).  Arguments against deriving Farbe from that source, i. e. PERḰ, come from Gothic farw shape, which falls in line with Old Irish krunth and Sanskrit krip [कृप्] shape and Latin corpus body; shape (Proto-Indo–European root is KʷREPO). The meaning colour might thus be a more recent semantic shift from shape, restricted to Germanic tongues.  But the Gothic word might also be interpreted as a loan from Arabic  farwa [فرو] (colourful) fur; clothing.           Flower head of safflower   Many European languages name safflower as false saffron or the like, e. g., Portuguese falso-açafrão, Italian falso zafferano or French safran bâtard bastard saffron. This habit is very old: Already in Classical Greek, there is a name krokos ho akanthodes [κρόκος ὁ ἀκανθώδης] spiny saffron.  Occasionally, the names for safflower and saffron are variants of each other, or the same word loaned by different routes: Croatian šafranika/šafran (similar in other Yugoslavian tongues), Portuguese açafroa/açafrão, Romanian șofrănaș (şofrănaş)/șofran (şofran) and Slowak azafrán/šafrán. A rather tricky case is Azeri: Both spices may be named zəfəran (from the Persian name of saffron), yet for safflower, also the Russian word for saffron, şafran, may be employed.  The Yiddish name zeyfblum [זײפֿבלום]  means soap-flower (zeyf [זײף] soap and blum [בלום] flower). It is hard to explain. It could be related to the oil extracted from the seeds, which can be converted into soap; but the same is true of all other oilseed plants, too.  The Greek name for safflower, knikos [κνίκος], relates to Old Greek knekos [κνῆκος] or knikion [κνίκιον], which also meant safflower; the oldest recorded form of that Greek name is knakos [𐀏𐀙𐀒] found on Mycenaean clay tablets, which, however, signified saffron. That word is of Indo–European origin and related to Sanskrit kanchani  [कांचनी] golden, made from gold (also used as a plant name for turmeric), Old Prussian cuncan brown and English honey (Old English hunig); the underlying root can be reconstructed as K(E)NƏKO (golden) yellow. In modern botanical terminology, the genus name Cnicus denotes the blessed thistle (Cnicus benedictus), a plant with yellow to orange flowers that is losely related to safflower.

Bay leaf shrub           Branch of Bay Leaves  ",
    "etymology": "English laurel is derived from the Latin name of the tree, laurus. Almost all languages of Western, Central or Northern Europe have related names, e. g., German Lorbeer, Danish laurbær, Swedish lager, Finnish laakeri, Italian alloro, Catalan llor, Portuguese louro, Slovenian lovor and Russian lavr [лавр].  The origin of Latin laurus is not known with certainty; it is not related to Latin laus praise. Since Latin L often corresponds to Greek (and Proto-Indo–European) D, there is the faint possibility of a connection to Greek daphne (see below). A more promising theory claims a hypothetical daurus as the original form, which would then be related to the Indo–European root DERU tree, in particular oak (see juniper for its affiliation). It is interesting to observe that in oldest Greece, oak (drys [δρῦς]) was the tree sacred to the god Zeus, while laurel took over this place in the classical period.           Laurel (bay leaf) tree           Bay twig   In the ancient Greek tongue, bay was named daphne [δάφνη] after the nymph Daphne, who was turned to a laurel shrub to escape Apollon’s per­secution. The god Apollo, then, deve­loped the habit to wear bay twigs in memory of his un­returned love (it may seem note­worthy that the ancients con­sidered this incident a tragedy — for Apollo, who lost the girl he was after). The hapless nymph is still remembered in some languages of Eastern Europe and West Asia: Bay leaves are called dafin in Romanian, dafni [δάφνη] in Modern Greek, dapna [დაფნა] in Georgian, defne in Turkish and dafinë in Albanian. There are also names meaning leaves of Daphne: Hebrew aley daphna [עלי דפנה], Bulgarian dafinov list [дафинов лист] and Armenian tapni derev [դաբնի-ի տերեւ].  In modern botanical terminology, Daphne denotes the genus of the toxic plant spurge laurel (Daphne mezereum, Thymelaeaceae/Thymeleanales/Dilleniidae).  The English term bay leaf (Middle English baye, Old French baie) derives from Latin bacca berry, meaning originally the fruits. "

    "etymology": "The name borage can, by way of French and Spanish, be traced back to Medieval Latin borrago. The latter name is generally accepted to have Arabic origin; it has been proposed to derive it from Andalusian Arabic abu buraq father of sweat (standard Arabic abu araq [أبو عرق]) or from abu huras father of roughness. In the first case, the motive would be the use of bor­age lea­ves in dia­phoretic medi­cines, in the sec­ond case the rough leaf sur­face.  Many Euro­pean lan­guages have names related to borage: French bour­rache, German Bor­retsch, Serbo-Croatian borač [борач], Basque borrai, Hungarian borrágófű, Greek borantsa [μποράντσα], and Bulgarian porech [пореч]. Also the Hebrew name of borage, borag [בוראג], is part of that series; I suspect it is a rather young loan.  Despite the Arabic origin of borage, modern Arabic has no related plant name. Instead, borage is often named himhim [حمحم], a name shared with related rough-leaved plants like bugloss (Echium) and oxtongue (Anchusa). A more specific Arabic name is lisan athaur [لسان الثور], which transparently means tongue of the bull (lisan [لسان] tongue and thaur [ثور] bull), obviously in reference to the thick, uneven leaves. The Semitic root TWR bull is remarkably similar to many Indo–European terms for bull, e. g., archaic English steer (Old English steor), German Stier, Latin taurus and Greek tauros [ταῦρος]. The reconstructed Proto-Indo–European form, (s)taur-, is likely a loan from an ancient Semitic tongue.          Borage plant           Borage flowers   The charac­teristic cu­cumber aroma of borage gives rise to names like Swedish gurk­ört, German Gurken­kraut, Dutch kom­kommer­kruid, Finnish kurkku­yrtti, Bela­rusian aguročnik [агурочнік] and Russian ogurechnaya trava [огуречная трава], all meaning cucumber herb; con­cerning the second elements in these names, see mugwort  (-wort, -wurz, -ört) and savory (-kraut, -kruid). Evidently, also the Baltic names (Lithuanian agurklė, Latvian gurķumētras, and Estonian kurgirohi) contain a cucumber element.           Borage flowers           Borage flower   It is quite amaz­ing that Ger­manic lan­guages have two different names for cucumber, which despite their similarity cannot be proven to be related.  English cu­cum­ber and Dutch kom­kommer can be traced back to Latin cucumis cu­cum­ber; that name can­not be explained further, but is has sur­vived into modern botanical nomen­clature, where the veg­etable cu­cum­ber is known as Cucumis sativus. Compara­tively few Romance lan­guages have con­served the Latin word, e. g., French con­combre and Catalan co­gombre.  In contrast, Italian cetriolo cu­cum­ber derives from Latin citrullus watermelon, which in turn might be related to citrus (see lemon), and the Iberic name of cu­cum­ber, pepino, relates to Latin pepo pumpkin.          Borage flower   On the other hand, German Gurke or Nor­we­gian agurk derive from Late Greek an­gou­rion [ἀγ­γού­ριον] cu­cum­ber, which either be­longs to Old Greek aoros [ἄωρος] green, im­mature, or is a loan from a doubious Persian angarah melon.  The Greek word was trans­ferred to many Slavonic lan­guages (Czech okurka, Russian ogurets [огурец], Polish ogórek) and entered Modern German as a loan from Polish; from there, it spread to many tongues of Northern Europe: Swedish gurka, Norwegian agurk, Lithuanian agurkas, Latvian gurķis and Estonian kurk. English gherkin also belongs to that group.   Quite confusingly, the German name Gurkenkraut is also used for dill, not because dill smells like cucumber (which it doesn’t), but because German cooks almost automatically use dill to flavour cucumber dishes.

    "main-constituents": "The pungent principle, capsaicin, is contained only in small amounts, as low as 0.001 to 0.005% in mild and 0.1% in hot cultivars (see chiles for details on capsaicin). Apart from capsaicin, the taste of paprika is mostly due to essential oil (<1%; with long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons, fatty acids and their methyl esters); paprika scent is mostly due to a range of alkylmethoxypyrazines (e. g., 3-isobutyl 2-methoxy pyrazine, earthy flavour). Ripe paprika contains up to 6% sugar. Furthermore, paprika contains sizable amounts (0.1%) of vitamin C; this substance was first isolated from ripe paprika pods by the Hungarian chemist Albert Szent-György, who later won the Nobel Prize for this work.  Paprikas derive their colour in the ripe state mainly from carotenoid pigments,  which range from bright red (capsanthrine, capsorubin and more) to yellow (cucubitene); total carotenoid content in dried paprika is 0.1 to 0.5%.  Chile cultivars which produce yellow but no or little red pigments appear yellow to orange when ripe. A small number of cultivars does not produce significant amounts of carotenoids; when chlorophyll levels decrease in the last stages of ripening, these chiles develop a pale hue often referred to as white. Due to small amounts of chlorophyll and/or yellow carotenoids, the white is, however, more precisely described as a pale greenish–yellow.           Black Prince, an ornamental breed rich in anthocyanin pigments (tepín- or piquín type).   Some varie­ties of paprika contain pigments of antho­cyanin type and develop dark purple, auber­gine-coloured or almost black pods; in the last stage of ripening, however, the anthocyanins get decomposed, and the unusual darkness thus gives way to normal orange or red colours.  The same anthocyanins cause the dark spots which are sometimes seen on unripe fruits or particularly the stems of paprika plants and which almost all paprika varieties can develop. In other Capsicum species, anthocyanin production is a rare phenomenon (e. g., scarlet lantern, an Andean cultivar of C. chinense). Origin Since different varieties of bell peppers have been cultivated in America long before the arrival of the Europeans, their native countries cannot be unambiguously determined;  South American origin is, however, established for all species of genus Capsicum, which emerged probably in the area bordering Southern Brazil and Bolivia. Thence, the species moved to the North, being dispersed by birds.           Bolivian Rainbow chile (flowers and unripe fruits)   The three species C. annuum, C. frutescens and C. chinense evolved from a common ancestor located in the North of the Amazon basin (NW-Brazil, Columbia). Further evolution brought C. annuum and C. frutescens to Central America, where they were finally domesticated (in México and Panamá, respectively), whereas C. chinense moved to the West and was first put to cultivation in Perú; (although today it is not much cultivated in South America). Two other species were first cultivated in Western South America: C. baccatum in the Peruvian lowlands and C. pubescens at higher elevations, in the Andes (Perú, Bolivia, Ecuador). See chile for more information about these species.  As paprika plants tolerate nearly every climate, the fruits are produced all over the world. A fairly warm climate is, however, necessary for a  strong aroma; therefore, in Europe, Hungarian paprika has best reputation; the best comes from the Kalocsa region.  In the Unites States, California and Texas are the main producers.

A rather common designation of paprika is sweet pepper: Spanish pimiento dulce, French piment doux, Kazakh qızıl burış [қызыл бұрыш] and Arabic fulful halu [فلفل حلو]. Note that in most of these languages, the word for pepper may also mean chile, so it would perhaps be more accurate to translate these names by sweet chile or sweet chile pepper. In the same spirit, Chinese tian jiao [甜椒] literally means sweet Sichuan pepper (not to be confused with gan jiao [甘椒], which has the same literal meaning but refers to allspice).  Yet other tongues have names for paprika that mean red pepper, e. g., Turkish kırmızı biber, Armenian garmir bghbegh [կարմիր պղպեղ], Bulgarian cherven piper [червен пипер] and Russian perets krasni [перец красный]. These may lead to confusion as in a plethora of other lan­guages, similar names are reserved for chiles.  Other English names are bell pepper and pod pepper because of the shape.  Most confusingly, the English plural peppers always seem to imply some sort of paprika (also vegetable bell peppers or hot chile peppers), and never true black pepper! For reasons of clarity, the term pepper for Capsicum species will be totally avoided on this page. Instead, I will use paprika throughout for mild or medium-hot varieties and chile for hot varieties.  The word paprika was borrowed from Hungarian (paprika) or Serbian (paprika [паприка]); it entered a great number of languages, in many cases probably via German. In the end, also paprika is derived from a name of black pepper, in this case Serbian papar [папар]. In most languages, paprika denotes the dried spice only, though in some (e. g., German) it is commonly used for the vegetable bell pepper. The form paprika is valid in countless European languages, while examples with slightly deviating spelling include Italian paprica, Polish papryka, Bulgarian piperka [пиперка], Hebrew paprika [פפריקה] and Japanese papurika [パプリカ].  The botanical species name Capsicum is a neo-Latin derivation of Greek kapsa [κάψα] box, capsule and refers to the shape of the fruits. There is an alternative, though much less probable, derivation starting from a related verb, kaptein [κάπτειν], translated bite. The verb’s basic meaning, however, is seize, grasp; it may also mean grab using the teeth; bite, but even from this meaning it’s a wide semantic shift to biting in the sense of pungent. The old German name Beißbeere biting berry for hot chiles is probably a loan translation based on the false etymology.  The genus name annuum means annual (Latin annus year).

    "origin": "Since different varieties of bell peppers have been cultivated in America long before the arrival of the Europeans, their native countries cannot be unambiguously determined;  South American origin is, however, established for all species of genus Capsicum, which emerged probably in the area bordering Southern Brazil and Bolivia. Thence, the species moved to the North, being dispersed by birds.           Bolivian Rainbow chile (flowers and unripe fruits)   The three species C. annuum, C. frutescens and C. chinense evolved from a common ancestor located in the North of the Amazon basin (NW-Brazil, Columbia). Further evolution brought C. annuum and C. frutescens to Central America, where they were finally domesticated (in México and Panamá, respectively), whereas C. chinense moved to the West and was first put to cultivation in Perú; (although today it is not much cultivated in South America). Two other species were first cultivated in Western South America: C. baccatum in the Peruvian lowlands and C. pubescens at higher elevations, in the Andes (Perú, Bolivia, Ecuador). See chile for more information about these species.  As paprika plants tolerate nearly every climate, the fruits are produced all over the world. A fairly warm climate is, however, necessary for a  strong aroma; therefore, in Europe, Hungarian paprika has best reputation; the best comes from the Kalocsa region.  In the Unites States, California and Texas are the main producers.

    "etymology": "In many European languages, the name of this spice is somehow derived from the name of pepper, owing to the many confusions of pepper with other spices (for another example, see  allspice).  A rather common designation of paprika is sweet pepper: Spanish pimiento dulce, French piment doux, Kazakh qızıl burış [қызыл бұрыш] and Arabic fulful halu [فلفل حلو]. Note that in most of these languages, the word for pepper may also mean chile, so it would perhaps be more accurate to translate these names by sweet chile or sweet chile pepper. In the same spirit, Chinese tian jiao [甜椒] literally means sweet Sichuan pepper (not to be confused with gan jiao [甘椒], which has the same literal meaning but refers to allspice).  Yet other tongues have names for paprika that mean red pepper, e. g., Turkish kırmızı biber, Armenian garmir bghbegh [կարմիր պղպեղ], Bulgarian cherven piper [червен пипер] and Russian perets krasni [перец красный]. These may lead to confusion as in a plethora of other lan­guages, similar names are reserved for chiles.  Other English names are bell pepper and pod pepper because of the shape.  Most confusingly, the English plural peppers always seem to imply some sort of paprika (also vegetable bell peppers or hot chile peppers), and never true black pepper! For reasons of clarity, the term pepper for Capsicum species will be totally avoided on this page. Instead, I will use paprika throughout for mild or medium-hot varieties and chile for hot varieties.  The word paprika was borrowed from Hungarian (paprika) or Serbian (paprika [паприка]); it entered a great number of languages, in many cases probably via German. In the end, also paprika is derived from a name of black pepper, in this case Serbian papar [папар]. In most languages, paprika denotes the dried spice only, though in some (e. g., German) it is commonly used for the vegetable bell pepper. The form paprika is valid in countless European languages, while examples with slightly deviating spelling include Italian paprica, Polish papryka, Bulgarian piperka [пиперка], Hebrew paprika [פפריקה] and Japanese papurika [パプリカ].  The botanical species name Capsicum is a neo-Latin derivation of Greek kapsa [κάψα] box, capsule and refers to the shape of the fruits. There is an alternative, though much less probable, derivation starting from a related verb, kaptein [κάπτειν], translated bite. The verb’s basic meaning, however, is seize, grasp; it may also mean grab using the teeth; bite, but even from this meaning it’s a wide semantic shift to biting in the sense of pungent. The old German name Beißbeere biting berry for hot chiles is probably a loan translation based on the false etymology.  The genus name annuum means annual (Latin annus year). This name was chosen most unfortunately, because in the absence of winter frosts, paprika and its relatives can survive several seasons. In its natural habitat, paprika grows into large perennial shrubs. "

Note, however, that the Thai name pak chi farang may also mean parsley, which also deserves to be called foreign coriander, the similarities being more visual than olfactory; lookup errors in the dictionary may then result in long coriander being labelled as parsley in Asian supermarkts.          Wild growing Long Coriander plant   The Thai term farang [ฝรั่ง] foreign, Western, European has a complex history and derives, in last con­sequence, from the name of a Germanic people, the Franks! In Medieval Europe, the Franks had occupied a powerful position (see also lovage for the herbal edict of Charle­magne), and a large percentage of the Crusaders were Franks. So it was natural to call the continent Europe just firanja Frank country in Arabic. Modern Standard Arabic forms are ifranji [إفرنجي] (noun), faranj [فرنجى] (adjective) European, where the initial variation (ifra vs. far) results from different strategies to avoid the initial consonant cluster. From Arabic, the word spread eastward, e. g. Urdu frangistan [فرنگستان], Sanskrit phiranga [फिरंग] and Kannada paramgi [ಪರಂಗಿ] Europe, and Kurdish farangi [فةرةنگی], Dhivehi faranjee [ފަރަންޖީ], and Khmer barang [បារាំង] foreigner.

    "main-constit­uents": "The pericarp contains max. 2.5% essential oil (mainly limonene and citral) and several bitter flavone glycos­ides: Neo­hesperidin and naringin, whose sugar component is neo­hesperid­ose, and rutin (see also rue), erio­citrin and hesperidin, whose sugar component is rutinose. Both sugars are di­saccharids of glucose and rhamnose (6-desoxy­mannose). Furthermore, orange contains the triterpene derivative limonin, which is contains in the plant as a tasteless monolactone. Its slow reaction to a bitter dilactone is the reason why orange juice turns bitter after some time. Carotenoids are responsible for the orange colour of the fruit skin.  The dark red colour of the so-called blood orange (Citrus sinensis cv. Sanguinelli, Citrus sinensis cv. Moro) is due to pigments of anthocyanin type (delphidin and others). Blood oranges were first grown in Sicily around 1850 from plants imported from China; even today, they are hardly grown on commercial scale elsewhere.  Orange leaves contain an essential oil in which the two terpenoids linalool and β-elemene were found as main constituents.  The essential oil from the flowers (neroli oil; only 0.2%) is of much more complex composition: Linalyl acetate (up to 20%) is the main component, furthermore limonene, several terpene hydrocarbons and terpene alcohols and the terpene ketone jasmone have been identified.           Kumquat tree with ripe fruits           A small orange tree, bearing fruits and flowers at the same time   The oil of the berga­mot orange contains about 50% limonene, 35 to 45% linalyl acetate and 20 to 30% linalool; further­more, 5% of the photo­sensitizer bergaptene (a furano-coumarin) have been found. Origin As with most other citrus fruits, the descendance of oranges is not known exactly. Despite the earlier belief that assumed a Chinese origin, it is now generally believed that oranges originate from Northern or North Eastern India.          A small orange tree, bearing fruits and flowers at the same time   The first or­anges were brought to Europe by the Moors, probably already in the 9.th century. They were first grown in the Arabic realms in Sicily and Spain.

Orange flower           Orange flowers and fruit www.botanikus.de  Etymology Most names of orange in European tongues ultimately derive from Sanskrit nagaruka [नागरुक] or naranga [नारंग] which was trans­mitted via Arabic (naranjah [نرنجة]) and Persian (Modern Farsi narenj [نارنج]). The word is, however, not native to Sanskrit, but has been borrowed from some other, unrelated tongue; it has been speculated that the ancient source language belonged to the  Austro–Asiatic language family, but another explanation tries to establish a link to a Dravidian root fragrant.

It first lost its initial n (Italian arancia) and then changed the new initial vowel under the influence of French or gold, ending up with, for example, with English orange.

The latter compounds are thought to reduce the quality of the spice. (J. Essent. Oil Res., 9,  597, 1997), (J. Essent.

    "origin": "Central Asia to Northern India ",
    "etymology": "The Hindi name shahi jira [शाही जीरा] Imperial cumin refers to the popularity of black cumin in the imperial (mughal) cuisine of Northern India; yet I found that caraway, a spice rare in India, is sometimes referred to by similar names.  Note that names with the similar literal meaning king’s cumin in Arabic mean another spice, ajwain.  The name kashmiri jira [काश्मीरी जीरा] is rare in Hindi, but the analog form kashmiri zireh [کشمیری زیرہ] is the standard denomination in the Kashmiri language. It refers to the  mountainous region Kashmir in North-Western India, where the Moghul Emperors (and later the British colonial officers) spent their summers to escape the heat in the Indian plains; thus, Moghul cooking has a strong foothold there.  Moreover, Kashmir is the only region in India where black cumin is produced. A similar motivation lies behind Nepali himali jira [हिमाली जीरा] Himalayan cumin, which falls into line with Farsi zireh kohi [زیره کوهی] mountain cumin.  The most common Indic name for this spice is kala jira [काला जीरा] black cumin, archaically spelled kala jeera; the same name is, most often in English, sometimes given to an entirely unrelated spice, nigella (also called onion seed). Bengali kalo jira [কালো জিরা] and similar names in South India actually refer to nigella. Nigella is popular in the Middle East and Northern India, particularly Bengal.  Hindi  shahi jira [शाही जीरा] for black cumin should not be confused with the similar looking sajira [शाजीरा], which denotes the olfactori­cally somewhat similar caraway. In some other Indian languages, the names might have different meaning, or mayby just mislabeling is very common. "

This involves a cultivated variety (Br. juncea var. tsatsai) with swollen, fleshy stems and leaf bases. The vegetable is cured with salt and  chile paste and left to ferment; the finished product is known in English as Chinese pickled mustard or Sichuan vegetable (Chinese zha cai [榨菜]). ",

    "sensory-quality": "The dried seeds do not have any fra­grance, but exhibit a pungent taste after some time of chewing. Roasted seeds (more gray in colour) have a rich, nutty odour. ",
    "main-constituents": "Black mustard contains about 1% sinigrin (allyl­glucosinolate), a thioglycoside-like compound (a so-called glucosinolate) of ally isothiocyanate with glucose. By action of the enzyme myrosinase, allyl isothiocyanate, a pungent, lachrymatory and volatile compound, is liberated (0.7% of the dried seed). Besides allyl isothiocyanate, in Romanian Brown  Mustard another related compound is found, namely  crotonyl isothiocyanate (2-butenylisothiocyanate).  Isothiocyanates are also the main ingredients of white mustard, horseradish, wasabi, rocket and cress, all of which belong to the same plant family. The more distantly related capers similarly owe their pungency to an isothiocyanate.  Note that isothiocyanates are aggressive substances that have the function of a chemical weapon against herbivorous animals. They are dangerous also to plants; therefore, the isothiocyanates are stored in the plant organism as glucosinolates (formerly called thioglycosides) which are harmless. The free isothiocynates are quickly formed by enzymatic reaction whenever the plant tissue gets damaged. Although the chemical details are much different, the basic functionality of this defence system is similar to that found in cyanide-producing plants like almond.             Black mustard fruits            Ripening black mustard pods            Black mustard flowers   Like most seeds,  mustard seeds contain also significant amounts of fixed oil (30%), which is used  extensively for cooking in India (beware: the term mustard oil is both used for this fatty oil and the pure iso­thio­cyanates). Besides glycerides of linoleic and linolenic acid, mustard oil contains glycerides of erucic acid, which is considered harmful to human health; furthermore, traces of free iso­thiocyanates may be found in mustard oil. There­fore, de­spite its high frac­tion of un­satu­rated fatty acids (io­dine in­dex is 105), mus­tard oil can­not be rec­om­mended with­out quali­fi­ca­tion for cook­ing pur­poses (see also be­low). ",
    "origin": "Black mus­tard  is probab­ly en­demic in the Sou­thern Medi­terra­nean region, but has been culti­vated since thou­sands of years; there­fore, nu­merous culti­vars are found.  Botanically different, though of equal use in the kitchen, are the Sarepta mustard or Roma­nian Brown Mustard (Br. juncea) from Eastern Europe and the Indian Brown Mustard (Br. integri­folia or Br. juncea, a fertile hybrid from Br. nigra and Br. campes­tris) from India and Central Asia.  Of all three species, the latter is probably most commonly sold in the West. Although the pungency of black mustard is slightly stronger than that of brown mustard, black mustard is hardly planted in Europe anymore, and brown mustard is the dominating quality on the European market. The reason is that brown mustard, unlike black mustard, can be harvested by machines which make production much cheaper in countries where working force is expensive. ",
    "etymology": "The German Senf is a loan from Latin sinapi, as well as the Old English senep (preparation of mustard paste was introduced to central and Northern Europe by the Romans). The Latin term is probably from Greek (sinapi [σίναπι], also napy [νᾶπυ]); loans in other European tongues include Italian senape, Swedish senap and Yiddish zeneft [זענעפֿט].  The origin of sinapi is not known; it is certainly not Greek. Based on a short remark by Pliny, it has often been assumed to be a loanword from Egypt, although no corresponding Egyptian word could be found (Coptic sinarbi [ⲥⲓⲛⲁⲣⲃⲓ] looks more like a borrowing from Greek). A more modern approach puts sinapi into relation with Sanskrit sarshapa [सर्षप], identifying the latter as a non-Indo–European loan of Central Asian origin (the reconstructed form would be sinshap in the unknown language of the BMAC in Bactria). In that case, even Malay sawi might be akin, demonstrating the ability of words to travel vast disances even in the Bronze Age.  Sinapi is also the word used in the New Testa­ment for mustard; it appears in the famous Parable of the Mustard Seed found in all syn­optic gospels. Yet, Matthew and Luke com­pare mustard with a bird-housing tree (dendron [δένδρον], see also juniper for more linguistic notes) which is hardly tenable, as mustard is an annual herb whose tender branches cannot support birds. Mark gets the facts better when he calles the mustard plant the largest of all garden plants (lachanon [λάχανον]) and places the birds in the shadow of the branches on the ground below the plant. See also  pomegranate about plants in the Bible.          Black mustard flowers   Mustard (and similar words in Ro­mance lan­guages, and the German  Mostrich for mustard paste) is derived from Latin (vinum) mustum, must. Although mustard paste is today pre­dominantly prepared with vinegar and wine, the Romans (who made mustard seeds popular in Central and Western Europe) used must (young wine).  The Sanskrit names krishnaka [कृष्णक] and krishnasarshapa [कृष्णसर्षप] derive from an adjective krishna [कृष्ण] black (see also nigella).  Lastly, the genus name Brassica is Latin for cabbage, which belongs to the same genus. The origin of that word is dark; it is, however, attested in quite early Latin literature (Cato, around 200 B.C.) and thus unlikely to be a loanword from the North; this becomes even more plausible when the multitude and importance of cabbage vegetables in Roman diet are considered. Thus it is most likely that potential cognates like Welsh bresychen and German Wirsing cabbage  are borrowings from Latin and not the other way round. Surprisingly, German etymological dictionaries trace Wirsing not to Brassica but, via Lombard verza cabbage, to Latin  viridis green which I find much less convincing, both semantically and phonologically.  See nigella for the etymology the colour name black. "

    "main-constituents": "Black pepper contains about 3% essential oil, whose aroma is dominated (max. 80%) by mono­terpene hydro­carbons: sabinene, β-pinene, limonene, furthermore terpinene, α-pinene,  myrcene, Δ3-carene and mono­terpene derivatives (borneol, carvone, carvacrol, 1,8-cineol, linalool). Sesqui­terpenes make up about 20% of the essential oil. Main compound is β-caryo­phyllene, while others like α-humulene, β-bisabolone and caryo­phyllene oxide and ketone appear only in traces; yet some work reports significant amounts of germ­acrene D, a ten-ring sesqui­terpene hydro­carbon. Phenyl­propanoids (eugenol, methyl eugenol, myristicin, safrole) are found in traces, too.  The most important odorants organo­leptically in black pepper are linalool, α-phellandrene, limonene, myrcene and α-pinene; furthermore, branched-chain aldehydes were found (3-methyl­butanal, methyl­propanal). The musty flavour of old pepper is attributed to the formation of hetero­cyclic com­pounds (2-isopropyl-3-methoxy­pyrazine, 2,3-diethyl-5-methyl­pyrazine) in concentrations of about 1 ppb. (Eur. Food Res. Technol., 209, 16, 1999)  Loss of mono­terpenes (α-pinene, limonene) and other small molecules (methyl­propanal, 3-methyl­butanal, butyric acid) due to bad storage conditions yields aroma detoriation (especially for ground pepper) and should be avoided.  The essential oil of white pepper has received less attention; the content of essential oil is lower (1.5%), and the most abundant compounds are monoterpene hydrocarbons: limonene, β-pinene, α-pinene and α-phellandrene. Organo­leptically most important are linalool (although occurring as a minor component), limonene, α-pinene and phenyl­propanoids (eugenol, piperonal); furthermore, short-chain aldehydes and carboxylic acids have been found important. In overstored white pepper, skatole (3-methyl­indol) is formed (2 ppm) and imparts an disagreeable, faecal flavour. (Eur. Food Res. Technol., 209, 27, 1999)  The pungent principle in pepper is an alkaloid-analog compound, piperine; it is the amide of 5-(2,4-dioxymethylene­phenyl)-hexa-2,4-dienoic acid (piperinic acid) with azinane (piperidine); pepper contains only the trans,trans isomer (piperine proper), although the trans,cis conformer (isochavicine) may show up due to photo­isomerization. The other two possible isomers, cis,cis (chavicine) and cis,trans (isopiperine) have been synthesized.  Several piperine-analogs have been isolated from black pepper where the acid carbon backbone is partially hydrogenated (piperanine) or two carbon atoms longer (piperettine); amides of piperinic acid with pyrrolidine (piperyline) or isobutyl­amine (piper­longumine) have also been isolated. Total content of piperine-analogs in black pepper is 5% or more, roughly the half of which is piperine proper.  The dark colour of black peppercorns arises only during the drying process. Fresh pepper contains colorless ortho-diphenol glycosides which get enzymatically oxidized by ortho-diphenol oxidase. The resulting chinoid oxidation products poly­merize and impart a dark brown to black color to the peppercorns.           Black pepper leaf and unripe fruits © Liz Thomas  Origin Black pepper is native to Malabar, a region in the Western Coast of South India; today, this region belongs to the union state Kerala. Pepper is cultivated since millennia. The wild form has not yet been unambiguously identified, but there are closely related pepper species in South India and Burma. While black and white pepper were already known in antiquity, but green pepper (and even more, red pepper) is a recent invention. Pepper reached South East Asia more than two thousand years ago and is grown in Malaysia and Indonesia since about that time. In the last decades of the 20.th century, pepper production increased dramatically as new plantations were founded in Thailand, Vietnam, China and Sri Lanka. In the New World, Brazil is the only important producer; pepper plantations there go back to the 1930s.             In South India, tea and pepper plants are often grown together            Pepper plant climbing a support tree    The most impor­tant producers of black pepper used to be India and Indo­nesia. However, Viet­namese efforts to intro­duce pepper plan­tations to the country have proved very sucess­ful: Since about the turn of the mill­ennium, Vietnam is main pepper producing country in the world, ac­counting for about one third of all pepper (90000 tons). India now comes second with about 50000 tons, followed by Brazil and former Number Two, Indo­nesia, whose production went into sharp decline in the 2000s. Note, however, that pepper production, trade volume and price show strong fluctuations, making the pepper business a rather volatile and unpredictable market.  In trade, the pepper grades are identified by their origin. The most important Indian grades are Malabar and Tellicherry (Thalassery). The Malabar grade is regular black pepper with a slightly greenish hue, while Tellicherry is a special product (see below). Both  Indian black peppers, but especially the Tellicherry grade, are very aromatic and pungent. In the past, Malabar pepper was also traded under names like Goa or Alleppey (the town is today named Alappuzha). The pepper trade center in India is in Kochi, still much known under its old name Cochin.  India’s main pepper product is black pepper. Yet the Malabar region also has a tradition for white pepper, and green pepper production has been introduced in the 1980s.  In South East Asia, the most reputed provenances for black pepper are Sarawak in insular Malaysia and Lampong from Sumatra/Indonesia. Both produce small-fruited black pepper that takes on a grayisch colour during storage; both have a less-developed aroma, but Lampong pepper is pretty hot. Sarawak pepper is mild and often described fruity. Black pepper from other countries where it has been introduced to more recently is named after the trade center (Bangkok, Saigon); these provenances are less valued, as they vary in heat and lack the complex aroma found in Indian and (to lesser degree) Malesian cultivars. The most important source of white pepper is the small Indonesian island Bangka, south east of Sumatra. The peppercorns are named Muntok after the island’s main port. Smaller amounts of white pepper are produced in Sarawak, which is particularly light-coloured; the best quality is known as Sarawak Cream Label. There is also Brazil white pepper, but it has a poorer flavour and is, therefore, less reputated in the international trade.  Brazil produces black, white and green peppercorns; the pepper is grown along the Amazon river in the state of Pará, whence the paracress originates. Brazil almost held a monopoly for green pepper as the original production in Madagascar has declined, but the increasing Indian production has changed this picture. Brazil black and white pepper qualities are quite mild. All Brazil pepper is named after its main port, Belém. Etymology The name Pepper is derived from the Sanskrit name of long pepper, pippali [पिप्पलि, पिप्पली]. That word gave rise to Greek peperi [πέπερι] and Latin piper, which both became chiefly to mean black pepper instead of long pepper. See long pepper for details.           Black pepper, sterile plants   From Latin piper, the names of pepper in almost all con­tem­porary Euro­pean lan­guages are derived, directly or in­directly. Ex­amples include, besides pepper (Old English pipor), Czech pepř, French poivre, German Pfeffer, Finnish pippuri, Ukrainian perets [перець] and Yiddish fefer [פֿעפֿער]. Of all European languages, only some Iberic names (Spanish pimienta, Portuguese pimenta, but not Catalan pebre which is piper-derived) have a different origin, which is discussed under allspice.  Greek has loaned the word piperi to several Afro-Asiatic languages of the Middle East: Thus we find pipros [ⲡⲓⲡⲣⲟⲥ] in Coptic, al-filfil [الفلفل] in Arabic, and in Hebrew pepper is called pilpel [פלפל, nowerdays often written with vowels as פילפיל]. Since it arrived comparatively late (end of 4.th century) in the Mediterranean region, pepper is not named in the Old Testament. Non-Semitic languages of Western Asia often have similar names for pepper, which were probably derived from Greek without Latin intermediate: Examples include Turkish biber, Kurdish bibari [بیباری], Georgian p’ilp’ili [პილპილი] and Armenian bghbegh [պղպեղ].  The names of several other spices have in turn be influenced by pepper. While paprika is an adaption from a Serbian word meaning pepper, others have names indicating that they are seen as similar to pepper or even as pepper variants.  The following list includes names not only from English, but also from various European languages: peppermint, water pepper, chile (red pepper), savory (pepper herb), allspice (Jamaica pepper), chaste tree (monk’s pepper), cress (pepper grass), horseradish (pepper-root) and ginger (also pepper-root). In Chinese, many spices are named similarly as variants of the native Sichuan pepper.           Sterile black pepper shoot   The most com­mon name of black  pepper in Sans­krit lan­guage is maricha [मरिच or मरीच], which, as many flora-related terms, is a loan into Sanskrit deriving from an earlier local tongue, which the Vedic Aryans took up when entering the country. The original language is today suspected to belong to the Munda group, although the word has cognates with the original meaning preserved in some current Dravidian tongues, e. g., Tamil milagu [மிளகு] and Telugu miriyalu [మిరియాలు] pepper.  Ironically, maricha has not only left much less traces than pippali in non-Indic languages, but it has also changed its meaning in most modern descendants of the Sanskrit tongue (and in a few Dravidian languages, too): Words derived from marichan, e. g., Punjabi mirch [ਮਿਰਚ], Malayalam mulaku [മുളക്] or Dhivehi mirus [މިރުސް], have taken on the meaning chile almost throughout Exceptions to that rule are found in the Himalaya region: Nepali marich [मरिच] and Kashmiri marts [مرژ] both mean  black pepper). In the Maithili language (at least in the variant spoken in Nepal), marich [मरिच] means pepper, and mirchai [मिरचाई] denotes chile.           Pepper berries   Those Indian tongues which changed the meaning of the old pepper word to chile may still retain the original meaning in combination with qualifying adjectives. Examples are provided by Hindi and Urdu names of black pepper, kali mirch [काली मिर्च, کالی مرچ] and gol mirch [गोल मिर्च, گول مرچ], which literally mean black chile and round chile, respectively. A rather absurd example is Malayalam vella-kurumulaku [വെള്ളകുരുമുളക്] white pepper, literally white blackchile. That pepper is named after chile in Indian languages is quite ironic as pepper is native to India, whereas chile has been introduced only 500 years ago.  Sanskrit marichan is also the source of modern Indonesian merica and Khmer marich [ម្រេច], which has conserved the original meaning pepper; supposedly, that word has been transferred to Southeast Asian languages at the same time when pepper became known in Malesia and the South East Asian peninsular due to Indian influence (about 1000 years ago).  Sanskrit is rich in synonyms and has many more names for black pepper, some of which derive from the adjective krishna [कृष्ण]  black (see nigella). Yet another name is yavanapriya [यवनप्रिय] conserved in Modern Tamil as yavanappiriyam [யவனப்பிரிதம்]. The meaning of this compound is dear to the Greeks, hinting at the high commercial value of pepper.  See ajwain for the first element in that name.  Chinese hu jiao [胡椒], which literally means wild pepper, is the source of Japanese koshō [胡椒, こしょう] and Korean huchu [후추]. See Sichuan pepper about the origin of the Chinese name.

While paprika is an adaption from a Serbian word meaning pepper, others have names indicating that they are seen as similar to pepper or even as pepper variants.  The following list includes names not only from English, but also from various European languages: peppermint, water pepper, chile (red pepper), savory (pepper herb), allspice (Jamaica pepper), chaste tree (monk’s pepper), cress (pepper grass), horseradish (pepper-root) and ginger (also pepper-root). In Chinese, many spices are named similarly as variants of the native Sichuan pepper.           Sterile black pepper shoot   The most com­mon name of black  pepper in Sans­krit lan­guage is maricha [मरिच or मरीच], which, as many flora-related terms, is a loan into Sanskrit deriving from an earlier local tongue, which the Vedic Aryans took up when entering the country. The original language is today suspected to belong to the Munda group, although the word has cognates with the original meaning preserved in some current Dravidian tongues, e. g., Tamil milagu [மிளகு] and Telugu miriyalu [మిరియాలు] pepper.  Ironically, maricha has not only left much less traces than pippali in non-Indic languages, but it has also changed its meaning in most modern descendants of the Sanskrit tongue (and in a few Dravidian languages, too): Words derived from marichan, e. g., Punjabi mirch [ਮਿਰਚ], Malayalam mulaku [മുളക്] or Dhivehi mirus [މިރުސް], have taken on the meaning chile almost throughout Exceptions to that rule are found in the Himalaya region: Nepali marich [मरिच] and Kashmiri marts [مرژ] both mean  black pepper). In the Maithili language (at least in the variant spoken in Nepal), marich [मरिच] means pepper, and mirchai [मिरचाई] denotes chile.           Pepper berries   Those Indian tongues which changed the meaning of the old pepper word to chile may still retain the original meaning in combination with qualifying adjectives. Examples are provided by Hindi and Urdu names of black pepper, kali mirch [काली मिर्च, کالی مرچ] and gol mirch [गोल मिर्च, گول مرچ], which literally mean black chile and round chile, respectively. A rather absurd example is Malayalam vella-kurumulaku [വെള്ളകുരുമുളക്] white pepper, literally white blackchile. That pepper is named after chile in Indian languages is quite ironic as pepper is native to India, whereas chile has been introduced only 500 years ago.  Sanskrit marichan is also the source of modern Indonesian merica and Khmer marich [ម្រេច], which has conserved the original meaning pepper; supposedly, that word has been transferred to Southeast Asian languages at the same time when pepper became known in Malesia and the South East Asian peninsular due to Indian influence (about 1000 years ago).  Sanskrit is rich in synonyms and has many more names for black pepper, some of which derive from the adjective krishna [कृष्ण]  black (see nigella). Yet another name is yavanapriya [यवनप्रिय] conserved in Modern Tamil as yavanappiriyam [யவனப்பிரிதம்]. The meaning of this compound is dear to the Greeks, hinting at the high commercial value of pepper.  See ajwain for the first element in that name.  Chinese hu jiao [胡椒], which literally means wild pepper, is the source of Japanese koshō [胡椒, こしょう] and Korean huchu [후추]. See Sichuan pepper about the origin of the Chinese name. "

    "origin": "China. Licorice is a medical plant in China and India, and there­fore culti­vated.          Licorice (G. glabra) flowers  ",
    "etymology": "Licorice essentially derives from Old Greek glykyrrhiza [γλυκύῤ­ῥιζα], which is just a contraction of glykeia rhiza [γλυκεῖα ῥίζα] sweet root; compare also the modern Greek name glikoriza [γλυκόριζα]. For the first element glykys [γλυκύς] sweet see almond; the second element rhiza [ῥίζα] is cognate to English root, being derived from the Proto-Indo–European linguistic root WRED (see also horseradish).           Licorice shrub in full flower (G. glabra)           Licorice (G. glabra) flowers   In Latin tongue, the Greek plant name appears as liquiritia, being in­flu­enced by liquere flow for the liquid form of lico­rice juice. The British spel­ling liquo­rice has some­what con­served that re­la­tion. Latin liquiritia is the source of many names for lico­rice in modern Euro­pean lan­guages, e. g., German Lakritze, Yiddish lakrets [לאַקרעץ], Czech lékořice and Ukrainian lokrytsya [локриця]. In most of the Romance languages, the word was changed by metathesis between the sounds L and R (Provençal recalicé, French réglisse, Spanish regaliz). Basque erregaliz is a loan from these Romance forms.           Chinese licorice, G. uralensis www.ibiblio.org/herbmed       © Henriette Kress   The German name Süß­holz sweet wood and its Dutch analogue zoethout are probably simply calqued from liquorice. German süß sweet has many Germanic cognates (English sweet, Dutch zoet, Yiddish zis [זיס] und Danish sød, Old Norse sætr) going back to a Common Germanic root SWOTJA. There are also relatives outside the Germanic branch: Old Greek hedys [ἡδύς] (see also mint), Sanskrit svadu [स्वादु], Latin suavis, all meaning sweet, and the Greek noun hedone [ἡδονή] delight, pleasure; the Proto-Indo–European root may be reconstructed as SWEH₂DU sweet; pleasure.           Russian licorice, Glycyrrhiza echinata           Inflorescence of G. echinata           Chinese licorice, G. uralensis www.ibiblio.org/herbmed       © Henriette Kress   German Holz wood also has many relatives: Archaic and poetic English holt and Welsh celli wood, Russian koloda [колода] wood­block and Greek klados [κλάδος] branch. The original meaning seems to have been break, cut off, cf. Greek klan [κλᾶν] break, Lithua­nian kalti beat, forge and Latin clades hurt, damage.  The charac­teristic sweet taste of liquorice is also reflected in the Indian names. In Sanskrit, madhu [मधु] means sweet, pleasant. This element is found in names for licorice not only in Sanskrit (madhuka [मधूक] and yashtimadhu  [यष्टिमधु] from yashti [यष्टि] stem, stalk), but also in modern names of both South and North India, e. g., Marathi jestamadha [ज्यष्ठमध], Bengali yashthimodhu [যষ্ঠিমধু], Telugu atimadhuramu  [అతిమధురము] and Kannada yashthimadhu [ಯಷ್ಠಿಮಧು]. Outside of India, related names are Lithuanian saldymedis and Armenian madudag [մատուտակ]. The Proto-Indo–European root behind this element is MEDʰU  honey, sweet; see bear’s garlic for its linguistic affiliation.          Inflorescence of G. echinata   Further examples of sweet­ness moti­vating a name for licorice are Estonian magus­juur, Hun­garian édes­gyökér, Ukrainian solodkyj korin [солодкий корінь] and Bul­garian sladuk koren [сладък корен], all of which trans­late to sweet root. See also almond for the Slavonic terms for sweet.  Lastly, one should mention the Chinese name for the related species Gl. uralensis, which is gan cao [甘草] meaning sweet straw or sweet herb. The name has been trans­ferred to Vietnamese as  cam thao [cam thảo], to Korean as kamcho [감초] and to Japanese as kanzō [甘草, かんぞう]. The Japanese Kanji symbols literally mean sweet grass or sweet plant.  The Latin species name glaber bald, hairless refers to the seed pods which have a smooth surface; in other species of the genus, the fruits are pubescent.  The Semitic names of licorice, Arabic as-sus [السوس] and Hebrew shush [שוש], are of ancient origin attested in Akkadian as šûšu, which might be a loan from Sumerian šušum [𒈹𒂞]. From Arabic, the name has spread to some more languages, e. g., Swahili susu and Portuguese alcaçuz (see also caper about Arabic loanwords in Iberic tongues).

Lovage plant with flowers           Flowering lovage   Phthalides also ap­pear in some other plants from the carrot family, in particular the related celery.  Apart from this, these com­pounds are rare in the plant king­dom.  The hetero­cyclic aroma compound sotolone, which has been found both in fenugreek and in Maggi sauce, can be seen as a phthalide-related, simpler structure where the condensed benzene ring is missing. This chemical similarity might account for the similar flavour of lovage and fenugreek leaves, and also that of Maggi sauce, although I find the latter similarity less striking. Origin Probably Central Asia. Etymology Both English lovage and German Liebstöckel seem to contain an element meaning love, but this is just a product of folk etymology.

(Gordian,  86,  9, 1986)  This is astonishing: From considering related plants, one would have expected five-membered hetero­cycles (as in the closely related fenugreek) or coumarins (as in the related genus Melilotus, honey clover). On the other side, reaction of α‑ketocarboxylic acids towards heterocycles has been observed during wine storage. (Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 43, 2616, 1995)  Unfortunately, there appears to be no newer scientific work on the flavour components of this spice.          Blue fenugreek plant   In the seeds of blue fenu­greek, dios­genin glyco­sides were found which also ap­pear in fenu­greek seeds. Ap­parent­ly, they have yet found any pharma­ceutical application. Origin Blue fenu­greek is found in the Alps, in the moun­tains of East­ern and South East­ern Europe and in the Cau­casus. Etymology The German name Schabzieger­klee (usually spelt Schabziger­klee in Swiss German) alludes to the herb’s usage in cheese making, for Ziger is a regional, mostly Swiss, word for the milk proteins (casein) that remain after the whey has been separated. Cf. Zigerkraut herb for Ziger.  Most other names allude to the characteristic blue flowers, which distinguishes blue fenugreek from its relatives of genera Trigonella, Trifolium and Melilotus. The following table gives a summary; a dagger indicates that the colour adjective specifically describes a light or pale hue of blue.   languagenameblue  Latin  Trigonella caerulea  caeruleus † German  Blauklee  blau Swedish  blåväppling  blå French  mélilot bleu  bleu Portuguese  trevo-azul  azul Italian  meliloto azzurro  azzurro † Italian  fieno-greco ceruleo  ceruleo † Czech  pískavice modrá  modrý Polish  kozieradka błękitna  błękitny † Belarusian  pažytnik blakitny [пажытнік блакітны]  ???

Yet some other names are moti­vated by the aro­matic fra­grance of blue fenu­greek: Italian balsamo (see lemon balm for more ex­plana­tions on balsam) and French trèfle musque musky trefoil (see also nut­meg) or lotier odorant fragrant trefoil.  English blue has cognates in many Germanic languages, e. g. German blau, Icelandic blár, Swedish blå and Yiddish bloy [בלױ]. The English word took a more complicated route: It was borrowed from Old French bleu, which itself was taken from a Germanic source (root BLĒWA blue). The Proto-Indo–European root behind these names was reconstructed as BʰEL and is the progenitor of a number of adjectives for various, typically bright, colours: Latin flavus golden yellow (cf. English blond), Russian bielyj [белый] white (see white mustard) and Welsh blawar grey. English bleach and black are also part of that group (see nigella).          Blue fenugreek inflorescence   Romance lan­guages have two terms for blue: Italian ceruleo derives from Latin coelum sky. On the other hand, French azure, Italian azzurro and Spanish azul have a more com­plicated history that relates to the semi-precious stone lapis lazuli. The stone is named for an ancient mine location in today’s North­ern Afghani­stan and was trans­ferred west­wards as Persian lazhward [لاژورد] and Arabic lazward [لازورد]; there, the name of the stone was to denote the colour, and the initial L was mis­identified as the Arabic definite article and removed.           Blue fenugreek flowers   The term clover is in use for the several species species of the pea family, especially such with three-partite leaves. It is restricted to Germanic languages, e. g., German Klee, Dutch klaver, Danish kløver. The origin of that name is unknown, although it is attested in the oldest Germanic tongues, as Old English clafre and Old High German klēo (genitive case: klewes).          Blue fenugreek flowers   English has an­other general name for clover-like plants, tre­foil. This is of Ro­mance origin (cf. French trèfle, Catalan trèvol, Ro­manian trifoi) and ulti­mately de­rives from Latin tri­folium clover, tre­foil, which literally means three-leaf. See lemon verbena for the etymo­logy of Latin folium leaf.  Some European languages have yet another name for cloves which derives from Latin  lotus; examples are French  lotier and English melilot for the related genus Melilotus, which means honey-clover (see bear’s garlic for the first part of that name). The Ancient Greek name lotos [λωτός] denoted several different plants, not only clovers (also the related fenugreek) but also the lotus plant (Nelumbo nucifera) which is a sacred flower in Hinduism and Buddhism.

    "etymology": "The German name Schabzieger­klee (usually spelt Schabziger­klee in Swiss German) alludes to the herb’s usage in cheese making, for Ziger is a regional, mostly Swiss, word for the milk proteins (casein) that remain after the whey has been separated. Cf. Zigerkraut herb for Ziger.  Most other names allude to the characteristic blue flowers, which distinguishes blue fenugreek from its relatives of genera Trigonella, Trifolium and Melilotus. The following table gives a summary; a dagger indicates that the colour adjective specifically describes a light or pale hue of blue.   languagenameblue  Latin  Trigonella caerulea  caeruleus † German  Blauklee  blau Swedish  blåväppling  blå French  mélilot bleu  bleu Portuguese  trevo-azul  azul Italian  meliloto azzurro  azzurro † Italian  fieno-greco ceruleo  ceruleo † Czech  pískavice modrá  modrý Polish  kozieradka błękitna  błękitny † Belarusian  pažytnik blakitny [пажытнік блакітны]  ???

Yet some other names are moti­vated by the aro­matic fra­grance of blue fenu­greek: Italian balsamo (see lemon balm for more ex­plana­tions on balsam) and French trèfle musque musky trefoil (see also nut­meg) or lotier odorant fragrant trefoil.  English blue has cognates in many Germanic languages, e. g. German blau, Icelandic blár, Swedish blå and Yiddish bloy [בלױ]. The English word took a more complicated route: It was borrowed from Old French bleu, which itself was taken from a Germanic source (root BLĒWA blue). The Proto-Indo–European root behind these names was reconstructed as BʰEL and is the progenitor of a number of adjectives for various, typically bright, colours: Latin flavus golden yellow (cf. English blond), Russian bielyj [белый] white (see white mustard) and Welsh blawar grey. English bleach and black are also part of that group (see nigella).          Blue fenugreek inflorescence   Romance lan­guages have two terms for blue: Italian ceruleo derives from Latin coelum sky. On the other hand, French azure, Italian azzurro and Spanish azul have a more com­plicated history that relates to the semi-precious stone lapis lazuli. The stone is named for an ancient mine location in today’s North­ern Afghani­stan and was trans­ferred west­wards as Persian lazhward [لاژورد] and Arabic lazward [لازورد]; there, the name of the stone was to denote the colour, and the initial L was mis­identified as the Arabic definite article and removed.           Blue fenugreek flowers   The term clover is in use for the several species species of the pea family, especially such with three-partite leaves. It is restricted to Germanic languages, e. g., German Klee, Dutch klaver, Danish kløver. The origin of that name is unknown, although it is attested in the oldest Germanic tongues, as Old English clafre and Old High German klēo (genitive case: klewes).

Etymology Gale is an old name of unknown etymo­logy (Old English gagel). There are more names of the same source in the names of North Western Europe: German and Dutch Gagel and French galè.  An aromatic wax can be obtained from the fruits, thus the British name candle berry. This applies mostly to M. cerifera (the Latin species epithet has the same meaning: bringer of wax).           Gale branch           Female flowers of Bayberry, M. pensylvanica           Unripe gale fruits   The origin of the scientific genus name Myrica is Greek myrike [μυρίκη] tamarisk (e. g., Tamarix tetrandra), although I do not under­stand the deeper con­nection between the two aromatic shrubs. There might also be a relation to Greek myron [μύρον] balm (see also nutmeg).          Female flowers of Bayberry, M. pensylvanica   Many popular names link gale to myrtle, often with ad­jectives re­ferring to its habitat or geo­graphical distri­bution.

All these regions are known for oligo­trophic coastal plains, where gale thrives (or at least did so in the past).  A variation of this motive is found in a Portuguese name that likens gale to another aromatic Mediterranean shrub: alecrim-do-norte rosemary of the North (the latter name also denotes the unrelated chaste tree).  Norwegian pors and related names in other Scandinavian languages are difficult to explain; they seem to go back to a pre-Indo–European North European language.

In other work there are reports of C9 poly­unsaturated alkamides. These compounds are chemically and physiologically related to the sanshools found in Sichuan pepper. (Chem. Express, 7, 153, 1992), (Bioscience, Biotechnology and Biochemistry, 56, 795, 1992), (Phytochemistry, 51, 729, 1999)          Paracress flower. Cultivated forms like this one typically have only disk florets.   Besides the alk­amides, pungent non­volatile sesqui­terpenoids have been found, e. g., polygo­dial and eudesman­olide II. The former is the dominant con­stituent of two other pungent spices,  water pepper and Tasmanian pepper. (Chem. Express, 6, 993, 1991) From the flowers of paracress, traces of an essential oil were isolated, whose main constituents were limonene, β-caryophyllene, Z-β-ocimene, γ-cadinen, thymol, germacrene D and myrcene. (J. Essent. Oil Res., 3, 369, 1991), (J. Essent. Oil Res., 5, 693, 1993) Origin Both types of paracress stem from South America; they are native to tropical Brazil.

BTW, the same is true for the paranut or Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa, Lecythidaceae/Theales/Dilleniidae). See cress on the derivation of cress.  The genus name Spilanthes means stained flower, from Greek spiloma [σπίλωμα] stain and anthos [ἄνθος] flower; the reference is to the dark pollen which stains the bright petals. The species name oleracea goes back to Latin holus, a leaf vegetable, and alludes to the edible leaves; acmella, I think, is motivated by the sharp pungency: Greek  akme [ἀκμή] point, peak, related to Latin acer acute, sharp (Proto-Indo–European root H₂EḰ pointed).  Names like Swedish tandvärksplanta or synonymous English toothache plant refer to the anaesthetic action of the alkamid constituents of paracress; chewing a paracress flower head is effective to damp toothache, at least for a while.

    "main-constituents": "The content of essential oil in the petals is poor and far below 1%. Because of the volatility of rose oil, the content is highest on the first morning when the flower opens; therefore, rose flowers used for distillation are picked manually, day by day, before or at sunrise.  Characteristic components of rose oil are acyclic monoterpene alcohols, geraniol (up to 75%), citronellol (20%) and nerol (20%), and long-chain hydro­carbons like nona­decane or hen­eicosane (up to 10%).  An important trace component of rose oil is β-damascenone: Despite its low concentration (0.01%), that C13-nor­isoprenoid has  notable influence on the quality of the oil; together with the structurally related compounds β-damascone and β-ionone, it is enzymatically generated from carotenoids. Similarly, in both saffron and pandanus leaves, the dominant aroma molecules derive from enzymatic degradation of carotenoids.  Characteristic of the fresh flower’s odour is 2-phenyl ethanol, which is, though, lost during steam distillation and accumulates in the rose water. Thus, rose oil and rose water do not equal each other exactly.          Damask Rose Quatre Saisons Continue   Even in the best case, only 10 g of the essential oil are distilled from as much as 100 kg fresh rose flowers (0.01%). Re­distillation of the by-product rose water triples the yield, so that ap­proximate­ly 3000 to 5000 kg fresh rose flowers are needed for 1 kg rose oil.  Alternatively, extraction by solvents, typically hexane, can be used to obtain a semisolid, greenish mass (concrete).  The yield is about ten times as high as with distillation, and moreover, the natural content of 2-phenyl ethanol is preserved (ca. 60% of total volatiles). Origin Several plants of genus Rosa grow wild in from Western Europe to East Asia, with a center of diversity in Central Asia. Due to centuries of breeding, the original botanical relations between wild rose species are far from clear.  Most European rose varieties stem at least in part from Rosa gallica, which grows wild in the Caucasus Mountains. It appears that almost all roses grown in Europe, Western or Central Asia and North Africa, from antiquity to the 18.th century,  either belong to Rosa gallica or are gallica-derived varieties. Possible exceptions to that rule are the musk rose (Rosa moschata, India) or the Holy rose of Abessinia (Rosa richardii).          Damask rose Rose de Resht   Damask rose is a fertile hybrid of Rosa gallica with either Rosa phoenicia or Rosa moschata, and it is known since antiquity (see also Silphion); it is suspected that the hybrid first arose in Anatolia several millennia ago. Damask rose (or, in any case, roses very similar to today’s Damask rose) were known in Western Asia since the Bronze Age, and its cultivation later spread to Greece and Rome.  Damask rose is the dominant source of rose oil (also known as rose otto), although in the European middle ages, rose oil was obtained from R.  gallica flowers. In France and North Africa, rose oil is still obtained from R.  centifolia and centifolia–gallica hybrids. The rose mentioned in the Capitulare de villis of Charlemagne is probably dog’s rose, R. canina (see lovage). In China, native rose species (e. g., R. rugosa) have of old been used as source for floral scents in perfumery and for producing rose-flavoured black tea.          Fruits of Damask Rose   For the essen­tial oil busi­ness, highly scented rose varieties (oil roses) are grown in large scale.  Main pro­duction countries are France and Bulgaria in Europe, but far more oil is produced in Turkey and Iran, where rose oil and rose water are called for in religious ceremonies. Famous production sites are Shiraz and Meshed (Iran), Isparta (Turkey) and the Kazanluk valley (also spelt Kazanlik [Казанлък]) in Bulgaria.  Many more rose varieties are known, e. g., alba roses, which are probably hybrids of Rosa damascena with the central European wild species Rosa canina. Furthermore, there are hundred-leaved roses (Rosa centifolia), most popular in Provence, which derived from Rosa gallica by hybridization with another type, probably alba. They are named for the large number of petals in their densely stuffed flowers.           Damask rose Gloire de Guilan           Tea hybrid Climbing Mme Caroline Testout   All these roses flower only on one-year old branches, which is why they have only a short flowering period followed by development of new branches for next year’s flowers (some Damask roses, though, show a second short bloom in fall).  The China rose Rosa chinensis is different in bearing flowers of fresh branches, and can therefore flower and grow all year round. With the genes of Chinese rose available, European breeders created an amazing variety of new roses in the 18.th century. Examples include Bourbon roses, Portland roses, Noisette roses and later developments like Remontant roses and Tea roses with large, solitary flowers. Inclusion of Rosa multiflora into the genetic pool produces many-flowered roses, often referred to as polyantha and floribunda types.  Old garden roses is a term used for all roses bred before the introduction of the first tea rose hybrid (La France) in 1867, and is usually meant to include all varieties bread after 1867 that belong to types known before 1867. All Damask roses are old.           Damask Rose York and Lancaster with pink and white flowers           Damask Rose York and Lancaster with two-coloured flower   There is a number of dif­ferent Damask rose cultivars, which now become more and more available as interest in old roses in­creases in Western coun­tries. Some of these, mainly from the East, are chiefly valued as sources of essential oil, like the Ispahan rose (named after the Central Iranian city Isfahan [اصفهان]) or the Bulgarian rose (Bulgarska roza [Българска роза]), which is also known as trigintipetala thirty-petaled for its semi-filled flowers. Others, however, serve mainly ornamental purpose; most of these were developed during the 17.th and 18.th centuries by European breeders. Examples include Celsiana, Léda, Duc de Cambridge, Quatre Saisons, Ville de Bruxelles and Gloire de Guilan. A somewhat problematic case is the Rose de Resht, an unusually hardy variety, which is sometimes thought to be a gallica, although it was apparently imported from Iran.  The Damask rose cultivar York and Lancaster is named in reference of the so-called rose war between the House of York and the House of Lancaster (1455–1485). The two houses were represented by emblems showing the White Rose of York (Rosa alba Maxima) and the Red Rose of Lancaster (Rosa gallica Officinalis); as a sign of reconciliation, the victorious House of Tudor chose a new rose with inner white and outer red petals as its heraldic symbol.  No breeder has ever succeeded to create a rose of that two-coloured kind, but Rosa damascena versicolor York and Lancaster (a 16.th century achievement) comes close in having reddish–pink and white flowers on the same plant; occasionally, one finds even flowers combining both colours in one.           Damask Rose York and Lancaster with two flower colours  Etymology The name rose can be traced back, via Latin rosa, only to Greek rhodon [ῥόδον] (cf.  the name of the common ornamental rhodo­dendron [ῥοδοδένδρον] rose tree), but not further; the plant must have been known in bronze-age Greece as it appears in the Odysseia [Ὀδυσσεῖα] (see poppy on the Homeric epics). We do not know, however, which rose variety inspired the poet to his famous comparison of the goddess of dawn and rose flowers: rhododaktylos Eos [ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠῶς] rosy-fingered Eos.  The source of Greek rhodon is probably a tongue of Western Asia now lost. There are, however, related words that are no Greek loans, but derived from the unknown predecessor language by an independent route: Armenian vart rose [վարդ], Georgian vardi [ვარდი], Arabic al-ward [الورد], Hebrew vered [ורד] and Coptic urt [ⲟⲩⲣⲧ]. From Arabic, the word spread to a number of languages in Islâmic countries of Africa and Asia.  Compare also Slovenian vrtnica rose (besides rož) and the female name Warda popular in the Eastern Mediterranean.           Gallica rose Président de Sèze           R. rugosa, originally from China and Japan   The Latin name rosa, itself derived from Greek, is essen­tially the source of almost all names of rose in modern Euro­pean tongues, mostly with at most only slight varia­tion: The name rose is not only valid in English, but also in German, Danish and French; other Germanic names are Ice­landic rós, Swedish ros and Dutch roos. The Romance languages Italian, Spanish and Portu­guese have another common name, rosa. In Baltic and Slavonic tongues, the S sound got voiced throughout, and sometimes also palatalized: Latvian rozes, Lithuanian rožės, Czech růže, Polish róża and Russian roza [роза]. Basque has an initial vowel, arrosa. Examples of loans to non-European tongues are Kannada roja [ರೋಜಾ] and Japanese rozu [ローズ].          R. rugosa, originally from China and Japan   Yet we find a para­doxical situation also en­countered with some other spice names (parsley, ginger): Al­though the Old Greek name sur­vives in the majority of modern European languages, it has vanished from Modern Greek, which has an unrelated name, trianda­fillo [τριαντάφυλλο]. That name properly refers to the specific thirty-petal cultivar grown for rose oil in South East Europe (Old Greek triakonta [τριάκοντα] thirty and phyllon [φύλλον] leaf), but is now used as generic term for rose. That name has spread to Bulgarian as trendafil [трендафил] (slightly archaic) and to Albanian  as trëndafil.  The botanic epitheton damascena refers to Damascus, today capital of Syria,  whence the fragrant rose allegedly was brought to Europe during the crusades.  Sanskrit shatapattra [शतपत्त्र] means hundred leaves (referring to filled flowers) and vrittapushpa [वृत्तपुष्प] round flower.  The term attar for rose oil (also spelt otto) goes back to Farsi atar [عطر] perfume derived from Arabic itr [عطر] perfume. Cf. also Kazakh ätirgül [әтіргүл] perfumed rose.

The term attar for rose oil (also spelt otto) goes back to Farsi atar [عطر] perfume derived from Arabic itr [عطر] perfume. Cf. also Kazakh ätirgül [әтіргүл] perfumed rose. "

Obviously, pickled capers consist mainly of water (about 85%). The dry matter contains, besides bitter flavonoid glycosides, a mustard oil glycoside named glucocapparin (methyl glucosinolate), whence by enzymatic reaction the pungent principle of capers, methyl isothiocyanate, is liberated.  Of all mustard oils, methyl isothiocyanate is the most volatile and most susceptible to hydrolysis (degradation by water), especially at elevated temperature.           Caper flower           Caper flower   Among the fla­vonoids, rutin (named after its occurrence in rue) is the most important.

    "origin": "Capers can today be found growing wild all over Medi­terranean, and are frequently cultivated (e. g., in France, Spain, Italy and Algeria; furthermore, Iran, Cyprus and Greece produce significant amounts); their origin is, though, supposed in the dry areas of Western or Central Asia.           Caper plant with flower www.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de  ",
    "etymology ": "Caper and its relatives in several European tongues can be traced back to Classical Latin capparis caper. Latin capparis, in turn, was borrowed from Greek kapparis [κάππαρις], whose origin (as that of the plant) is unknown but probably West or Central Asia.  Another theory links kapparis to the name of the island Cyprus (Kypros [Κύπρος]), where capers grow abun­dantly.  Names of capers in most Euro­pean languages share a common origin and are indeed quite similar, for example, Italian cappero, French câpre, Estonian kappar, Swedish kapris, Czech kapara, Russian kapersy [каперсы] and Greek kappari [κάππαρη]. In English, the word appeared first as capers, which was, however, later interpreted as a plural, and the new singular caper was backformed.  Spanish tápana and related names of the Western Medi­terranean also derive from Latin capparis, although I do not understand the details. Provençal tapeno lies behind the name tapenade for a famous French appetizer (see olive).  The botanical species name spinosa thorny refers to the many sharp thorns of the plant, which are, though, missing in some modern cultivars; the latter are often referred to as a variety var. inermis (unarmed).           Caper flowers (ornamental dwarf variety) www.ruehlemanns.de           Caper branch with flowers and blossoms   The prefix al- in Iberic names (Portu­guese alcaparra caper,  Spanish alcaparrón caper berry) indicates that these names are not simply inherited from Latin, but have been borrowed from Arabic al-kabara [الكبر] the caper, where the article al has been interpreted as part of the word and thus included into the loan word. In last consequence, Arabic kabara [كبر] is, of course, related to Latin capparis.  The prefix al (sometimes el) is quite often found in loanwords of Arabic origin; most of these date back to the Arabic (Mauric) occupation of the Iberic peninsular, when European science enjoyed an enormous influx of ideas and knowledge from Arabic writers. Such words are particularly frequent in the fields of mathematics, medicine and astronomy (e. g., alkali, alcohol, alchemy, algebra, elixir, also star names like Altair or Algol); this usage demonstrates the enormous influence of Arabic science on the culture of medieval Europe. Due to the advanced Arabic medicinal lore, Arabic-derived plant names are quite common in Spanish and Portuguese.

    "plant-family": "Solanaceae (nightshade family). ",
    "sensory-quality": "Chiles may be expected to be hot and pungent. Once accustomed to their fiery pungency, one is surprised how many subtle flavours they may show: Fruity, earthy, smoky, fresh, sweet and flowery are just some of them. The greatest variety of chile tastes is, not surprisingly, found in México (for the usage of chiles in Mexican cuisine, see paprika).              Red Savina Habanero fruits            Until 2006, the Red Savina was regarded as the hottest chile on earth © Kristian Podrepsek   Chile hotness is measured in Scoville units, which is originally a subjective measure based on dilution of chile extracts and organoleptic evaluation by human testers; today, chile hotness is more frequently determined  by HPLC (high performance liquid chromato­graphy), whose results can loosely be correlated to traditional Scoville ratings; an approximate conversion generally accepted is that 15 Scoville units equal 1 ppm capsaicin plus capsaicinoids. The very hottest cultivars (Capsicum chinense) range around 200000 to 300000 Scoville units; the still quite fiery Thai chiles barely reach 100000; more common varieties like the  jalapeño (the default hot chile for US citizens) or the Italian peperoncino  generally  score  below 5000 Scoville units. Note that Scoville ratings conventionally refer to dried chiles; fresh chiles are milder by approximately one order of magnitude.  Whenever considering tabulated chile hotness data, it must be made clear that chiles tend to be extremely variable in their pungency and that even fruits harvested at the same time and from the same plant may differ drastically in their hotness. Moreover, since breeders have an interest in pushing their varieties as extra-hot, the date presented might be a subset of all data obtained. ",
    "main-constituents": "Chiles show more or less the same aroma components as paprika, but their content in capsaicin (the amide of 3-hydroxy-2-methoxy-benzylamine with 8-methyl-6-noneneoic acid) and related compounds (collectively called capsaicinoids) is much higher (up to 1%, which equals 150000 Scoville heat units). Only true capsaicin is responsible for the pungent and fiery taste of chiles; conventional analytic methods, however, do not yield the capsaicin content, but the sum of capsaicin and capsaicinoids; therefore, capsaicin content does not automatically relate to pungency.  Dihydrocapsaicin, the most important capsaicinoid, makes up about one third of the total capsaicin & capsaicinoids fraction. Other capsicinoids (nor-dihydrocapsaicin, homo-dihydrocapsaicin, homo-capsaicin) are only found in traces. It is not clear whether they are organoleptically inert or whether they might modify the pungency and taste of the chile.  The Central American species Capsicum chinense is characterized by very high content of capsaicin, typically 2% (equals 300000 Scoville heat units), which is not reached by the other species. A proprietary cultivar, red savina habanero, was long undisputedly considered the hottest chile on earth: It was measured to breathtaking 3.7% (577000 Scoville heat units). Although this high figure could never be reproduced, the red savina pods are really extremely hot.           Tezpur, the town where the hottest chile of the world was found   ",
    "the-hottest-chile-of-the-world-": "In August 2000, Indian scientists reported on a formerly unknown chile cultivar grown in the hills near the Central Assamese town of Tezpur which they initially classified as Capsicum frutescens var. Nagahari (although later this proved incorrect). This chile variety has been dubbed Tezpur chili, and is also sometimes errorneously referred to as Indian PC-1. Native names include Assamese naga jolokia [নাগা জলকীয়া] chile of the Nagas (the Nagas are a people inhabiting the border region between India and Burma, east of Tezpur), bih jolokia [বিহ জলকীয়া] poison chile and bhut jolokia [ভুত জলকীয়া] ghost chile (alternatively interpreted as Bhutanese chile, although I do not know whether it also grows in Bhutan), Manipuri umorok [উমোরোক, ꯎꯃꯣꯔꯣꯛ] tree chile, Bengali  bombai morich [বোম্বাই মরিচ] (in Bangladesh) or naga morich  [নাগা মরিচ] (just a translation of naga jolokia) and Hindi raja mirch [राजमिरंच] royal chile (calqued on the native names in Naga languages, which usually mean king’s chile, e. g., Angami Naga chüsi kedi and Tangkhul hao kasāthei).           Ripe naga jolokia pods growing in a village in Nagaland   This new chile type is reported much hotter than the Red Savina Habanero: Its heat was measured to incredible 855000 Scoville units, cor­respond­ing to 5.7% of capsaicin in the dried material (4.3% Capsaicin and 1.4% Dihydro­capsaicin; remarkably, other capsaicinoids are missing). There are plans to use this plant in the production of weapons (pepper spray) for private (anti-mugger defence) and for military (riot control) purposes. It is, however, not stated whether the value cited is typical for the variety, or just a rare exception. (Current Science, 79, 287, 2000; online [PDF])   Within a few months, the work on the Assamese mystery chile has attracted considerable criticism. The main problem is the lack of proper calibration of their HPLC apparatus; calibration is necessary for getting any absolute values.  At the same time, however, the authors used a literature value for the Red Savina that can hardly be compared with their relative figures that might easily be off by a factor of two or three. The authors probably had no access to Red Savina chiles, and it is almost impossible to tell what capsaicin content their apparatus would have reported for Red Savinas. Since North East India is difficult to access by non-Indians, no authentic naga jolokia material arrived in the rest of the world before 2004 which could have provided support for the implausibly high Scoville ratings. Most chile specialists considered it impossible that a frutescens should be that hot, anyway.           Fresh pod of naga jolokia © Dan Prall           Dried naga jolokia pods   Furthermore, there is a constant nationalistic tone in this paper that destroys the appearance of scientific objectivity (the work was financially supported by the Indian Defence Department). From my personal view, I’d like to add that in this work one paragraph of this very web page appears almost verbatim, without any attribution; this is annoying to me and sheds a poor light on the Indian scientist’s  knowledge and ethics.  In spring of 2003, a new rumour spread according to which the Tezpur chile in fact belongs to Capsicum chinense, which would make the claim of extreme heat more plausible. See also this article by Dave DeWitt.  At the same time, it became clear that the variety advertised as Indian PC-1 is not identical to the famed mystery chile. Rather, the Indian PC-1 is a typical frutescens with a Scoville rating less than 100000.  In 2006, the matter became finally clear. It was established that the Assam region indeed boasts a superhot  chinense chile that was previously unknown to the world. Since the pods have an elongated (yet broad-shouldered) shape deviant from the typical lantern shape, it appears that the original scientists misidentified the botanical species. There are, however, other chinense cultivars with similar pods, like the fatalii or the datil.          Dried naga jolokia pods   Seed material from Assam has been grown by a number of scientists and enthusiasts alike, and the fruits have throughout be proved extremely hot: They typically range around one Mega­scoville, in full agreement with the much-ridiculed figure published in the original paper, and thus much higher than any other tested variety. In the time since, hybrids of the naga jolokia with other chinensia have been bred and proved even higher ratings (e. g., Dorset Naga), but I hesitate to accept these artificial and perhaps short-lived products as on a par with traditional, provenly long-lasting chile cultivars.  Genetic screening showed that the naga jolokia is not a purebred chinense, but a hybrid with minor contributions of frutescens. This provides an explanation why the original scientiest classified it into the wrong species, although, morphologically, the chinense heritage is really dominating. The rather irregular capsaicinoid composition might also have in explanation in the frutescens admixture.  In the meantime, more South Asian chile cultivars have come to my knowledge, none of which is mentioned in any of my 20.th century chile literature; yet I do not know whether they have ever been subject to a HPLC for a determination of capsaicine content. Those chiles will be described in more detail later in this document, and still later I will discuss the use of these exotic chiles in the autochthonous cuisines on Sri Lanka, North East India and Nepal.           Capsicum chacoense, a wild species from Argentina  ",
    "origin": "The genus Capsicum stems from South America. See paprika for details. Unlike most other tropical spices, chiles are easy to cultivate; therefore, their cultivation and usage has spread all over the world, especially to regions with tropic climate. Main producer today is India, albeit mostly for domestic trade.  The geographical distribution of the five domesticated species across the cultivars is much different in the Old and the New World. In the Americas, there are areas of dominance for each species, while Africa and Asia show a more scattered distribution. The following table gives a coarse overview which will be discussed in more detail in later chapters.

    "etymology": "In many European languages, the name of chiles is somehow derived from that of black pepper. Sometimes, it is just a variation (Italian peperoncino), but more often, the name for chile is that of pepper with some meaningful epithet attached. The epithet may hint at the colour (French poivre rouge, Sinhala ratu miris [රතු මිරිස්] or Hebrew pilpel adom [פלפל אדום] red pepper), the increased potency (Spanish pimienta picante and Arabic filfil har [فلفل حار] pungent pepper) or the introduction by the Spaniards (Dutch Spaanse peper Spanish pepper).  The Italian name diavoletto is a diminutive form of diavolo devil, indicating the satanic piquancy of this spice.           C. chacoense wild chile with fruits (Argentina) www.ortagarden.com           Flower of Capsicum praetermissum (Brazil)   In many Euro­pean languages, chiles are known as pepper from Cayenne, e. g., Greek piperi kagien  [πιπέρι καγιέν], Latvian kajēnas pipari or Portuguese pimenta de caiena. The element Cayenne in these names is a loan from a Native American Indian language: Originally spelt cayan, it goes back to a member of the Tupi language family in which the spice was termed kyinha (also spelt quiínia). Today, Cayenne is also the name of the Capital of French Guyana, but I do not think there is a connection between those two names.  Not only European languages derive their names of chiles often from black pepper: Rather, this phenomenon is observed more or less all over the Old Worlds, where pepper has been known about two millennia before the discovery of America. For example, Arabic fulful [;فلفل] originally meant pepper (to which word it is related, anyhow). In modern Arabic, fulful is used for both black pepper and chiles, but more often for the latter; as an unambiguous term, fulful har [فلفل حار] hot pepper may be used for chile.  Similarly, in Chinese, chiles are known as la jiao [辣椒] hot pepper; in this case, however, the primary word jiao refers less to black pepper than to a native Chinese pungent spice, Sichuan pepper. Also, the Japanese name togarashi [唐辛子, とうがらし] compares chiles with another hot spice: Literally, it means Chinese mustard. Perhaps, the Japanese came to know chiles first by Chinese mediation.           Ripe ulupica chile (C. cardenasii), a Bolivian wild type   In India, many names of chile have been formed from ancient names for black pepper with is native to Southern India. In Tamil, for example, black pepper is known as milagu [மிளகு] and chile bears the name milagai [மிளகாய்] pepperfruit (the element kai [காய்] (unripe) fruits also appears as second syllable in mango).  The related Telugu language has miriyalu [మిరియాలు] for pepper and mirapakayalu [మిరపకాయలు] for chile.  The element mirch discernible an many Northern Indian names originates from Sanskrit maricha [मरिच] black pepper, which itself is probably a Dravidian loan and thus related to the Tamil and Telugu names given above.  See black pepper for more etymological details.  Since chiles are known in India only for about 5 centuries, there can be no classical Sanskrit name for them; yet there are Neosanskrit names for chile designed for use in modern Sanskrit works (e. g., scientific or medicinal literature): Ujjvala [उज्ज्वल] burning, bright, clear and marichiphala [मरिचिफल] pepper-fruit.  When Columbus found chiles on some Caribbean island, he reported the name aji (or axi) in the local Arawak (Carib) language. Today, ají is still in use in México and particularly in South America, where it is most commonly, but not exclusively, used in reference to C. baccatum. The Quechua name uchu is still in use among indigenous peoples in the Andes, but it is mostly replaced by ají in the Spanish-speaking population.  The English names chile or chilli are borrowed from  Náhuatl (native Mexican), where the plant’s name chilli  allegedly derived from a root  meaning red. It is not related to the country name Chile, which is supposed to derived from the Quechua word meaning end, because today’s Chile marks the southern end of the Inca Empire. Another theory links the toponym to an Araucanian term depth referring to the coastal lowlands as seen from the Andes.           Flower of Bolivian ulupica chile (Capsicum cardenasii)   There is con­siderable zeal in the discussion whether the spice should be called chile, chili or chilli in English. The form chilli is probably closest to the Náhuatl original, and it is the preferred form among historically minded USians and in Australia. The word chili has come to mean almost exclusively the Tex-Mex-food chili con carne in the USA, but is used for the spice in British English. The variant chilly (also the adverb of chill) has become obsolete; it bears connotations to the British Colonial Era and sometimes appears in brand names of products that go back to the first half of the 20.th century. Lastly, chile is the name of the spice in contemporary Mexican Spanish, and it is also quite popular in the USA. To make things worse, chiles are often referred to as peppers in English, which is of course a never-ending source of culinarily fatal misunderstandings.  For the botanical genus name Capsicum, see paprika; the species name frutescens is the present participle of a synthetic formation frutescere to become shrubby: Latin frutex shrub, bush and the verb fruticari sprout, furthermore Greek bryein [βρύειν] grow, thrive and possibly also German Kraut; see savory for etymologically related words. Note the inchoative suffix -sc- getting in a state of. Pubescens hairy very well describes the characteristic attribute of this species (hairy leaves), but some cultivars of C. annuum also have pubescent leaves, e. g., the Mexican serrano chile. The other species names are less motivated: Baccatum berry-shaped (see also bay) is not well chosen, as only some cultivars of this species feature globular, berry-like fruits, but others bear the usual long and finger-shaped  pods. Lastly, chinense is a complete misnomer, as this chile variety has absolutely nothing to do with China. By the way, also the species name of paprika, annuum, has no factual justification.  The name bird’s eye is often used to denote any small-sized, pointed chile of high pungency, because of the similarity to an avian pupil. There is also the name bird pepper or bird chile for wild forms of chiles, whose small, very pungent fruits separate easily from the calyx and are dispersed by birds. "

    "origin": "The clove tree is en­demic to the North Moluccas (Indo­nesia) and was of old culti­vated on the islands of Ternate, Tidore, Bacan and the West coast of Halma­hera. The Dutch extended culti­vation to several other islands in the Moluccas, particularly Ambon, but only after the end of the Dutch mono­poly (18.th century), clove trees were intro­duced to other countries.           The flag of the former sultanate of Zanzibar and Pemba   The most impor­tant pro­duction area today is the island of Pemba, which together with Zanzibar forms one part of the state of Tanzania. The whole island of Pemba is covered with clove gardens, and it is reported that the island can be smelled on any ship approaching it. The short-lived Sultanate of Zanzibar and Pemba (1963–1964) had a flag showing two clove buds.  Cloves are also grown on other East African islands, most notably, Madagascar. In Indonesia, clove production has recovered from poor decades after World War II, such that the country was forced to import cloves to satisfy the huge domestic market. Since the 1980s, Indonesia is again producing in large scale, although little of the Indonesian crop gets exported.           Old clove tree           Ripe clove fruits (mother of clove)           Clove trees in Northern Sulawesi  ",
    "etymology": " The name clove, as well as Spanish clavo, Catalan clau, Por­tuguese cravinho and Tagalog clovas, ulti­mately derives from Latin clavus  nail (be­cause of shape resem­blance). The word made its way into English via Old French clou. The word clove is related to the verb cleave (which is what you can do with a nail) and therefore also to clove as in a clove of garlic. See there for further connections of clavus.  Most Germanic and Germanic-influenced tongues have a different word for clove: German Nelke, Norwegian nellik, Danish nellike, Icelandic negull, Swedish neijlikor, Yiddish negelen [נעגעלען], Finnish neilikka, Estonian nelgi and Sranan nagri. These are related to German Nagel, nail.  Nail and its cognates in Germanic languages (Old High German nagal, English nail, Icelandic nagli, Swedish nagel) basically means either nail of finger or toe or slim pointed piece of metal; the second meaning is younger and does not appear outside the Germanic languages: Old Irish ingen, Latin unguis nail, Latvian nags  hoof, Greek onyx [ὄνυξ] claw, Sanskrit anghri [अंघ्रि] foot. The vowel variations made reconstruction of the  Proto-Indo–European root behind all these forms somewaht difficult, but laryngal theory suggests H₃NOGʰ or H₃N̥Gʷʰ (with possible extensions) nail, claw as a reasonable guess.  Cloves are named nail spice in other languages, too; for example, take Russian gvozdika [гвоздика] which comes from gvozd’ [гвоздь] nail. As another example, one finds a group of related names in Western to Central Asia: Georgian mikhak’i [მიხაკი], Azeri mixək and Farsi mikhak [میخک] belong to the same kin as  Azeri mıx and Farsi mikh [ميخ] nail. Similar names for nail are found in several Turk languages (Turkish mıh and Uighur mih), suggesting that the name is ultimately of Altaic origin.                         Clove flowers            Unripe clove buds   In the same spi­rit, Hebrew tsiporen [ציפורן] also has two mean­ings finger­nail and clove, although it is not related to any of the former men­tioned lan­guages. In its Old Hebrew form tsipporen [צפרן, צִפֹּרֶן], that word also ap­pears in the Old Testa­ment, but only in the mean­ings finger nail and tip, point, not in re­ference to the spice. It is be­lieved that cloves came to the Medi­terra­nean no sooner than the first or second century B.C.          Unripe clove buds   Another unre­lated lan­guage names cloves as nails: Basque iltze-kanela literally means cinnamon nails (iltzatu nail); so the spice was named both for its shape and, even if in­accu­rately, for its fra­grance (it can also be called iltzea for short). See Indo­nesian cinnamon for the etymo­logy of the second part of this name.  German  Gewürz­nelke, Dutch kruidnagel or Swedish krydd­nejlikor are emphatic formations meaning condiment clove. For the determinative elements in these compounds, see mugwort for the German and  savory for the Dutch and Swedish names.          Clover flower close-up           Clove flower   In Old Greek, the clove  spice was known as karyo­phyllon [καρυό­φυλλον], which ap­pears to be a com­pound of two Greek nouns: karyon [κάρυον] nut and phyllon [φύλλον] leaf. Yet such a compound is poorly motivated: Clove is neither nut nor leaf, and does not even look so. More­over, practi­cally all names of foreign spices in Greek tongue are loans from languages of the trading peoples (see cinnamon, long pepper, cassia, sesame, ginger and malabathron for examples). So I suspect that karyo­phyllon is, in fact, a corrupted name of cloves in a tongue of South or South East Asia, probably India.  For example, there is the Sanskrit name katuka phala [कटुक फल] pungent fruit (or pungent nutmeg) given to an unidentified aromatic plant (both elements of this name have no Indo–European etymology, and it is supposed that they stem from an unknown Indian language, possibly Dravidian or Munda). Since cloves would probably have been traded in the seaports of South India, it is interesting to note that the modern Dravidian languages still have remarkable similar names with a consonant pattern K–R–[PB]:  Tamil karambu [கராம்பு], Malayalam karayanpu [കറയാന്പൂ] and also the Indo-European Singhalese karabu [කරාබු]. Malayalam even shows the palatal glide present in the Greek word, in the right position.  The search for a possible source of Greek karyo­phyllon yields further hits in all major language families of South East Asia: Thai kanphlu [กานพลู], Lao kanphu [ກ້ານພູ], Khmer klampu [ក្លាំពូ] and Tagalog klabong. While it would be tempting to add Japanese kurobu [クローブ] to that list, this name is just a modern adaption of the completely unrelated English clove as it is sometimes found on the net; the traditional Japanese name of clove derives from Chinese (see below).          Sterile branch of clove   Karyophyllon [Καρυό­φυλλον] is not only direct  pro­genitor of modern Greek gari­falo [γαρί­φαλο] clove, but was also, via Latin gariofilum, transferred to some present-day Romance lan­guages, e. g., Italian garo­fano, and French girofle.  Further related words for clove are Turkish karanfil, Serbian karan­filić [каран­филић], Bulgarian karamfil [карам­фил], Kazakh qalampır [қалампыр], Dhivehi karanfoo [ކަރަންފޫ], Swahili karafuu and several Semitic names, e. g., Arabic al-qaranful [القرنفل] and Amharic krinfud [ቅርንፉድ].             Sterile branch of clove            Branch with clove flowers            Young clove buds   In some lan­guages, cloves share the name with the fragrant ornamental carnation or pink (Dianthus caryo­phyllatus), e. g., German Nelke, Italian garofano, Greek garifallo [γαρύ­φαλλο], Bela­rusian gvazdziki [гваздзікі] and Russian gvozdika [гвоздика]. In English, the orna­mental is also known as gilly­flower which is etymo­logically related to Greek karyo­phyllon and thus akin to all the names men­tioned in the pre­vious para­graph.  Another group of names for clove are found in India, e. g., Pashto and Urdu lung [لونګ, لونگ], Kashmiri rong [رونگ], Hindi and Punjabi laung [लौंग, ਲੌਂਗ], Gujarati laving [લવિંગ], Bengali labango [লবংগ] and Telugu lavangalu [లవంగము]. These names have no discernible etymlogy in the Indo–Aryan (or Dravdic) languages and are in all likelihood loans; they might be distantly related to the group of karyo­phyllon and kanplu. I found the suggestion that they derive from a Malaiic language, which would bring us again to the vicinity of Tagalog klabong. Note, however, that cloves are called cengke in both modern Indonesian and Malay.  The Tamil and Ma­layalam names ilavangam [இலவங்கம், ഇലവംഗം] are part of the group of names quoted in the pre­vious para­graph. Sur­prisingly, their prime denotation is cinnamon tree, alt­hough, according to dictio­naries, they may mean clove on occasion. Such behaviour again points to these names being loanwords that just got attached to whatever aromatic comes first to the mind; also, these languages use an epenthic i regularly whenever a loanword starts with a consonant (such as L,R) or cluster that is not allowed word-initially.  The botanical genus name Syzygium derives from Greek syn [σύν] together, with and zygon [ζυγόν] yoke (from zeug­nynai [ζευγνύναι] join). The name refers to the petals, which are merged (joined) into a cap-like structure. Being fused, they cannot open at the onset of flowering but seperate from the plant and fall to thee ground; the showy part of the flower is made entirely of the anthers.          Clove berries (mother of clove)   The Chinese term for cloves is  ding xiang [丁香], also trans­cribed ting hsiang and in count­less other variants. Similar to English (which has the gilly­flower complication and other European tongues, Chinese uses the same word for a fragrant ornamental flower, in this case lilac (Syringa spp.). In Chinese, the lilac genus is termed ou ding xiang [欧丁香], roughly European clove, and the single species get compound designations, e. g., bao ma ding xiang [暴马丁香] for the species native to East Asia (S. reticulata). In the meaning clove, the word was was trans­ferred to Viet­namese as dinh huong [đinh hương] and to Korean as chong-hyang [정향] The second element xiang [香] means spice, fragrance and is often found  in the names of aromatics or well-flavoured foods; it also forms the first part in the toponym Hongkong (Cantonese  heung gong [香港], Mandarin xiang gang [香港] fragrant harbour).           Ship model made from dried cloves (handicraft of the Moluccas)           Clove berries (mother of clove)   The first part of that name, ding [丁], typi­cally means small thing, chunk; it also de­notes a specific cut­ting technique to chop meats into rather small pieces, and a male sur­name; it does not mean nail. Yet, I think that the original meaning of ding xiang might also have been nail spice: First, the shape of the Chinese character 丁 evolved from a nail, and the modern language has a homo­phonous word ding [钉] nail (the nail character is com­posed of jin [金] metal with the phonetic com­plement ding [丁] and thus means a thing made from metal and spoken ding). Second, the Korean chong-hyang is written 釘香 in the now obsolete Sino–Korean writing, using the traditional variant of the nail character. Perhaps, such a spelling was also possible in an earlier stage of Chinese, although 钉香 is not valid in the contemporary language.  As usual, the situation is even more complicated in Japanese. There is a term spelt identically to the Chinese and pronounced cho-ko [丁香, ちょうこう, チョウコウ]. But this is less commonly used than cho-ji [丁子, 丁字, ちょうじ, チョウジ], which has two Kanji spellings (the first one is more frequent). The Kanji at the second position just means small thing.

    "main-constituents": "There is little information about the volatile constituents of mahaleb cherry kernels. The literature does not mention cyanogenic glycosides of amygdalin-type (see bitter almond), but some coumarin derivatives (coumarin, dihydrocoumarin, herniarin) have been found (J. Nat. Prod., 49,  721, 1986). A more recent study reports glycosidically bound 4-methoxyethyl-cinnamate (which is structurally related to coumarines) (J. Pharm. Sci., 59, 551, 2006). Moreover, coumarin has also been isolated from the dried bark, where they form the majority of the volatiles (Flavor and Fragrance Journal, 21, 306, 2005). In all probability, coumarines are the main flavour compounds of the kernels.           Mahaleb cherry flowers www.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de   From the seeds, a fixed oil can be extracted (30%) that is dominated by oleic acid and linoleic acid. Furthermore, it contains some unusual conjugated fatty acids: 9,11,13-octadeca­trienoic acid (cis,trans,trans form: eleostearic acid, cis,trans,cis form: punica acid). Origin Mahaleb cherry grows abundantly in the Mediterranean, Southeast Europe and West Asia; it is, however, sometimes found in Central Europe, where it prefers warm and dry climate. Its culinary use is restricted to the South Eastern part of Europe (Greece, Armenia) and West Asia (Turkey, Lebanon, Syria). Main export country is Syria.  Mahaleb cherry trees, being rather robust and insensitive to diseases, are commonly used as stock in grafting cherries, especially in the USA. Etymology The identical names in Arabic (al-mahlab [المحلب]) and Hebrew (mahaleb [מהלב]) hint at a common origin. Allegedly, both words derive from a common Semitic root ḤLB milk.  Cf. the Hebrew noun halav [חלב] milk and the Arabic verb halaba [حلب] milk (take milk from an animal). I do not get the semantic connection between cherry and milk, unless it is the white colour of the flowers.             Mahaleb cherry flowers            Mahaleb cherry flowers    Literature men­tions another related plant name, galbanum, which refers to Ferula galbaniflua, a plant closely related to asafetida, and the latex obtained therefrom; here, the name is motivated by the milky plant juice, which when dried becomes an aromatic resin which has of old been used in incenses.  Possibly, some names for fenugreek also derive from the Semitic root ḤLB: Hebrew hilbeh [חילבה] and Arabic al-hulbah [الحلبه], which was borrowed by Spanish as alholva.  English cherry (Old English cyrstrēow cherry tree) has many relatives in European languages: German Kirsche, Italian ciliegio, Hungarian cseresznye, Estonian kirss, Maltese ċiras, Greek kerasi [κεράσι] and Armenian geras [կեռաս] can be traced back to Greek kerasos [κέρασος] cherry tree and kerasion [κεράσιον] cherry, which entered some of the languages mentioned above via Latin cerasus cherry tree. The word has been speculated to be of  Semitic origin (allegedly Akkadian karšu, which I was unable to verify in a dictionary, and more recent Arabic karaz [كرز]), but sometimes in Indo–European origin is claimed, deriving from a postulated Proto-Indo–European root ḰERMUS cherry, with unclear relation to KER cornel.  Swedish vejksel (or the German term Weichsel sour cherry, morello) is related to Russian vishnya [вишня] cherry and goes back to Latin viscum and Greek ixos [ἰξός] mistletoe; sticky glue  used by bird-catchers, because a resin from cherry trees was used to prepare  lime-twigs; cf. the scientific term viscous syrupy. At the bottom lies  the Proto-Indo–European root WIKS sticky plant, itself possibly a derivation of WEIS melt, dissolve (cf. Latin virus slime, poison).  I have no good explanation for the puzzling Polish name antypka and its Russian analogue antipka [антипка]. A wild guess would be to link it with the Turkish city of Gaziantep (formerly Antep).

    "sensory-quality": "Strongly aromatic, sweet, pleasant, warm and but hardly bitter or astringent. Compared to its relatives, cinnamon has a fresh or lively tone that is missing in all other cinnamon species. I have to admit, though, that the adjective lively may not be of much help to readers unless they have tried both, in which case they won’t need my description anyway. ",
    "main-constituents": "The essential oil of cinnamon bark (max. 4%) is dominated by the two phenylpropanoids cinnamaldehyde  (3-phenyl-acrolein, 65 to 75%) and eugenol (4-(1-propene-3-yl)-2-methoxy-phenol, 5 to 10%). Other phenylpropanoids (safrole, coumarin [max. 0.6%] cinnamic acid esters), mono- and sesquiterpenes, although occurring only in traces, do significantly influence the taste of cinnamon. Another trace component relevant for the quality is 2-heptanone (methyl-n-amyl-ketone). The slime content of the bark is rather low (3%). See also cassia and tonka beans on possible health hazards relating to coumarin.           Young cinnamon leaves have a red colour   From  cinnamon leaves, another essential oil (1%) can be obtained that consists mainly of eugenol (70 to 95%) and can be used as a substitute for clove. Small amounts (1 to 5%) of cinnamaldehyde, benzyl benzoate, linalool and β-caryophyllene have also been found. A completely different composition is found in the essential oil of cinnamon root bark; here, camphor (60%) dominates. This oil is not used commercially. Last, in cinnamon fruits (cassia buds, cinnamon buds), the main components were found to be trans-cinnamyl acetate and β-caryophyllene. (Flavour and Fragrance Journal, 12, 331, 1997) ",
    "origin": "Cinn­amomum zeylanicum originates from the island Sri Lanka (formerly called Ceylon), southeast of India. It is also native to south-west India and the Tenasserim Hills of Burma. Several attempts have been made to transplant cinnamon trees to other parts of the tropic world, but they have become naturalized only on the Seychelles. Related cinnamon species are found in Indonesia, Vietnam and China. ",
    "etymology": "English cinnamon, German Zimt, Lithuanian cinamonas, Belarusian cynamon [цынамон], Serbocroatian cimet [цимет], Yiddish tsimering [צימערינג] and Armenian ginamon [կինամոն] all derive from Latin cinnamomum, which was in turn a loan from Greek kinnamomon [κιννάμωμον] (also spelled kinamomon [κινάμωμον]).           Cinnamon flowers www.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de   The Greek had borrowed the word from a Semitic tongue, cf. Old Hebrew kinamom [קנמון] and Aramaic qunimun [ܩܘܢܝܡܘܢ]. However, these words can hardly be native Semitic, and their further origin is not known; it has been suggested that they ultimately stem from early Malaysian language and are thus related to modern Indonesian kayu manis  sweet wood (although this is a problematic assumption). Similar descriptive designations also exist in other languages, e. g., Dhivehi foni thoshi [ފޮނި ތޮށި] sweet bark.  For names like Dutch kaneel and French cannelle, see Indonesian cinnamon. Another class of names, exemplified by Hindi dal chini [दाल चीनी], Farsi darchin [دارچین] and Turkish tarçın, is explained in the article on cassia; see also juniper for an etymological explanation of the first part in these names.  Most Indian languages have names of the dalchini type, but some tongues of Southern India name cinnamon by a word whose relatives in other languages mean cloves, e. g., Tamil ilavangam [இலவங்கம்]. "

    "note": "The name curry plant is often used for Heli­chrysum italicum (Aster­aceae), a relative  of im­mortelle; several sub­species grow in the Euro­pean Medi­terranean countries. The essential oil shows consider­able infra­specific variation; its main com­ponents are mono­terpene hydro­carbons (pinene, cam­phene, myrcene, limonene) and mono­terpene-derived alcohols (linalool, ter­pinene-4‑ol, nerol, geraniol, also their ac­etates); further important aroma com­ponents are non­terpenoid acyclic β‑ketones, which give rise to a somewhat dis­agreeable flavour (e. g., 2,5,7‑trimethyl­dec-2‑en-6,8‑dione, 2,5,7,9‑tetramethyl­dec-2‑en-6,8‑dione, 2,5,7,9‑tetramethyl­hendec-2‑en-6,8‑dione, 3,5‑dimethyl­octan-4,6‑dione, 2,4‑dimethyl­heptan-3,5‑dione).  This curry herb is occasionally used for culinary purposes, but its fragrance is not alike to curry leaves at all. For me, it reminds more of sage and mugwort. It can go, together with other Medi­terranean herbs, for Italian or French food, but it should not be tried for Indian recipes.           Curry leaf © Liz Thomas           Fresh fruits of the Curry tree © Liz Thomas  Used plant part The leaves. A curry leaf is compound and consists of up to 20 leaflets arranged in pairs along the middle rib. For cooking purposes, the leaflets are usually torn from the rib to facilitate eating; in recipes, ten curry leaves more often than not refers to ten leaflets, or about one half to one full leaf.  Since curry leaves lose their delicate fragrance soon after drying, you should try to obtain them fresh; don’t waste your time with the dried stuff! Plant family Rutaceae (citrus family).

Typical figures run from 0.5 to 2.7%.           Curry flower, close-up www.botany.hawaii.edu   © Gerald Carr   The following aroma com­ponents, mostly sesqui­terpene hydro­carbons, have been identi­fied in curry leaves of Sri Lanka (in paren­theses, the content in mg/kg fresh leaves): β‑caryo­phyllene (2.6 ppm), β‑gurjun­ene (1.9 ppm), β‑elemene (0.6 ppm), β‑phel­landrene (0.5 ppm), β‑thujene (0.4 ppm), α‑selinene (0.3 ppm), β‑bisa­bolene (0.3 ppm), further­more limonene, β‑trans‑ocimene and β‑cadinene (0.2 ppm). (Phytochemistry, 21, 1653, 1982)  Newer work has shown a large variability of the composition of the essential oil of curry leaves. In North Indian plants, mono­terpenes prevail (β‑phel­landrene, α‑pinene, β‑pinene), whereas South Indian samples yielded sesquiterpenes: β‑caryo­phyllene, aroma­dendrene, α‑selinene. (Flavour and Fragrance Journal,  17,  144, 2002)          Curry tree twig with ripening berries  Origin   The curry tree is native to India; today, it is found wild or culti­vated almost every­where in the Indian sub­continent excluding the higher levels of the Hima­layas, though it reaches the Inner Terai valleys in Nepal. In the East, its range extends into Burma.          Flowering curry trees growing wild in Nepal  Etymology The botani­cal name Murraya koenigii refers to two 18.th century botanists: the Swede Jo­hann Andreas Murray (1740–1791) and the German Jo­hann Ger­hard König (1728–1785).           Flowering curry trees growing wild in Nepal           Sterile curry tree growing in a greenhouse   The English term curry is of Indian origin: In Tamil, the most im­por­tant South Indian lan­guage, the word kari [கறி] means soup or sauce; this is also the basis of the Tamil name for curry-leaves, kari­veppilai [கறிவேப்பிலை] which contains ilai [இலை] leaf. In English usage, curry has a wider meaning encom­passing not only spicy foods of various kinds, but also Indian-style spice mixtures (curry powder).

    "note": "There is a lot of confusion about the names of this spice: It is referred by a multitude of names which, in other sources, might mean something else entirely. In some English sources, it is called black cumin, but I think this is a poor choice, as the name black cumin is already reserved for another, somewhat obscure, spice from Central Asia and Northern India. I have also read the name black caraway (for its usage, together with caraway, in Jewish rye breads) and black onion seed (motivated by the similarity to the seeds of onion); but there is no botanical relation between nigella and any of these plants. Most curious is the name nutmeg flower, which is quite dangerous to use because a host of European languages denotes mace as flower of nutmeg or similar.  In the USA, nigella is often known as charnushka (deriving from the Russian name chernushka [чернушка] and probably introduced into American English by Armenian emigrants). The Hindi term kalonji is widely used by Indians even when speaking English.  Moreover, nigella is sometimes confused with black sesame seeds; occasonally, it is even named such. More rarely, there is confusion with ajwain, which in some languages bears similar names; ajwain itself is notorious for being confounded with numerous other plants.  I have decided to stick with the more neutral botanical name Nigella, mainly on the reason that this name cannot so easily be confounded with anything else.  Note, however, that there are several Nigella species besides N. sativa; the second most important species seems to be N. damascena, a common ornamental in Europe. By the use of the genus name for the spice, I do not imply that all members of the genus can be used culinarily. The seeds of N. damascena do have some flavour, but I find them inferior to those of the true spice N. sativa.          Nigella seeds  ",
    "used-plant-part": "The deep black, sharp-edged seed grains. Plant family Ranunculaceae (buttercup family). Sensory quality Nigella seeds have little odour, but when ground or chewed they develop a  vaguely oregano-like scent. The taste is aromatic and slightly bitter; I have seen it called pungent and smoky and even compared to black pepper, but I cannot agree with that comparison.  There is, however, some pungency in unripe or not yet dried seeds.             Nigella flower (culinary)            Unripe Nigella capsule (culinary)            Nigella plant with unripe seed pods  Main constituents The seeds contain numerous esters of structurally unusual unsaturated fatty acids with terpene alcohols (7%);  furthermore, traces of alkaloids are found which belong to two different types: iso­chinoline al­kaloids are repre­sented by nigellimin and nigellimin-N-oxide, and pyrazol alkaloids include nigellidin and nigellicin.  In  the essential  oil (avr. 0.5%, max. 1.5%), thymo­quinone was identified as the main component (up to 50%) besides p-cymene (40%), α-pinene (up to 15%), di­thymo­quinone and thymo­hydroquinone. Other terpene derivatives were found only in trace amounts: Carvacrol, carvone, limonene, 4-terpineol, citronellol. Further­more, the essential oil contains significant (10%) amounts of fatty acid ethyl esters. On storage, thymo­quinone yields di­thymo­quinone and higher oligo­condensation products (nigellone).  The seeds also contain a fixed oil rich in unsaturated fatty acids, mainly linoleic acid (50 – 60%), oleic acid (20%), eicodadienoic acid (3%) and dihomo­linoleic acid (10%) which is charac­teristic for the genus. Saturated fatty acids (palmitic, stearic acid) amount to about 30% or less.  Commercial nigella oil (Black Seed Oil, Black Cumin Oil) may also contain parts of the essential oil, mostly thymo­quinone, by which it acquires an aromatic flavour. Origin Probably Western Asia. Although nigella is not mentioned in the common Bible translations, there is good evidence that an obscure plant name mentioned in the Old Testament means nigella; if true, this would indicate that nigella is cultivated since far more than two millennia (see pomegranate). Today, the plant is cultivated from Egypt to India. Etymology Nearly all names of nigella contain an element meaning black in reference to the unusually dark colour of the seeds. The following table compares some names of Nigella to local term for black. Most of the names have a second part that means cumin, caraway or simply grain.    languagenameblack  German  Schwarzkümmel  schwarz Norwegian  svartkarve  svart Swedish  svartkummin  svart Latvian  melnsēklīte  melns Lithuanian  juodgrūdė  juodas Estonian  mustköömen  must Finnish  mustakumina  musta Hungarian  feketeköméni  fekete Latin  Nigella  niger Italian  grano nero  nero Spanish  niguilla  negro Portuguese  cominho-preto  preto Romanian  negrillică  negru Polish  czarnuszka  czarny Ukrainian  chornushka [чорнушка]  chornyj [чорний] Russian  chernushka [чернушка]  chyornyj [чёрный] Czech  černý kmín  černý Slovak  černuška  cern, cernoch Slovenian  vzhodna črnika  črn Croatian  crni kumin  crn Serbian  crno seme [црно семе]  crn [црн] Greek  melanthion [μελάνθιον]  melas [μέλας] Arabic  kamun aswad [كمون اسود]  aswad [اسود] Amharic  tik'ur azmud [ጥቁር አዝሙድ]  tik'ur [ጥቁር] Turkish  kara çörek otu  kara Turkish  siyah kimyon  siyah Farsi  siah daneh  [سیاه دانه]  siah [سیاه] Kurdish  siawasa  [سیاوصة]  siawa [سیاو] Sanskrit  krishnajira [कृष्णजीर]  krishna [कृष्ण] Hindi  kalaunji [कलौंजी]  kala [काला] Panjabi  kalonji [ਕਲੌਂਜੀ]  kala [ਕਾਲਾ] Sinhala  kaladuru [කලාදුලු]  kalu [කලු] Kannada  kari jirige [ಕರಿ ಜೀರಿಗೆ]  karidu [ಕರಿದು] Malayalam  karinjirakam [കരിഞ്ചീരകം]  kari [കരി] Chinese  hei zhong cao [黑種草]  hei  [黑] Thai  thian-dam [เทียนดำ]  dam  [ดำ] Indonesian  jintan hitam  hitam            Related species N. hispanica (Spain)           Capsule of N. ciliaris  With the grow­ing popularity of nigella seed oil as a natural remedy, new names for this spice have been devised that are more easy to remember and do not sound foreign. In English, it is often simply called black seeds (cf. blackseed oil); in Finnish, there is the analogous name musta siemen. In Italian, the similar name grani neri black grains is used. Cf. also Chinese hei zhong cao [黑種草] black plant seeds.  The colour adjective black (Old English blæc) is unique to English; it derives from a Proto-Indo–European root BʰEL burn that, quite confusingly, also gave rise to bleach (Old English blǣcan), where the common concept seems to be the lack of true colour, and blue (see white mustard and blue fenugreek for further related colour names). The more common Old English term for black, sweart, is only conserved in the archaic  swarthy dark, but its cognates are found in most other Germanic languages, e. g., Dutch zwart, Yiddish shvarts [שוואַרץ], Swedish svart and German schwarz (Old High German swarz), going back to Common Germanic SWARTA. The word is mainly Germanic; a possible non-Germanic relative is Latin sordes dirt.  The Romance terms for black (Italian nero, French noir, Romanian negru) derive from Latin niger. One theory links it to night (Old English nēah) and its cognates in many other languages, e. g., Latin nox, Greek nyx [νύξ] and Sanskrit nakta [नक्त] (Proto-Indo–European root NOKʷT dark, dim). Yet another theory holds that niger belongs to the group of Latin nocere to do harm and Greek nekros [νεκρός] corpse and thus to the Proto-Indo–European root NEḰ kill, death. In Portuguese, black is negro or preto, where the latter appears related to black.           Ripening nigella capsules   In the Slavonic tongues, the words for black are rather similar and have a common origin: Serbo­croatian crn [црн], Russian  chyornyj [чёрный], Czech černý and Polish czarny derive from an Proto-Indo–European root KER burn, fire, which has representatives in many languages: Lithuanian karštis heat, Latin cremare burn, combust (thence ceramics) and carbo charcoal, Old Norse hyrr fire and English herth (Old English heorþ). This is related to Sanskrit krishna [कृष्ण] dark, black, which is also the name of a deity in the Hindu pantheon (avatar of Vishnu), who got this name due to his dark blue complexion. See also black pepper and black mustard for more Sanskrit names with the krishna element. See also mugwort for another related Slavonic plant name, chernobyl.  Among the Indian names for Nigella, three different groups can be isolated, besides several singularities: In the North-West, a cluster is found exemplified by Hindi, Punjabi und Urdu kalaunji [कलौंजी, ਕਲੌਂਜੀ, کلونجی]; east of that, but still in the very North, the spice bears a different name, e. g., Nepali mugrelo [मुग्रेलो] or Maithili (Bihari) mangrela [मङरैला]. In the North-East and the South of the subcontinent, the dominating names are of the type of Bengali kalo jira [কালো জিরা], Oriya kala jira [କଳାଜୀରା], Kannada kari jirige [ಕರಿ ಜೀರಿಗೆ] or Tamil karunjiragam [கருஞசீரகம்]; all these mean black cumin and, thus, can lead to confusion with another spice that stems from the North-Western Himalaya and is usually referred by similar names in the local languages (and also on this page): Black cumin (Hindi, Panjabi kala jira [काला जीरा, ਕਾਲਾ ਜੀਰਾ], Urdu kala zira [کالازیرہ], Nepali kalo jira [कालो जीरा]).           Ripe fruit capsules of ornamental N. damascena (Love in a mist)   The old‑fash­ioned English plant name gith can be traced back to a black-seeded herb mentioned by Plinius; he renders the name as gith or git, which is probably borrowed from a Semitic tongue  of the Eastern Medi­terranean (cf. Hebrew gad [גד] coriander). The same name is used by Charlemagne in his Capitulare de Villis for nigella (see  lovage). In modern English, gith is more often used for corn cockle (Agrostemma githago) also distinguished  by black seeds, which, however, contain toxic saponines.  Onion seed (or German  Zwiebelsame or Finnish sipulinsiemen) refers to the similarity with the seed of onion plants. The latter, however, are tasteless and cannot be used as a spice.  Ornamental breeds of the closely related species N. damascena are known as Devil in the bush or Love in a mist; in German, there are comparably poetic names like Jungfer im Grünen (Danish jomfru i det grønne) Maiden in the green or Gretchen im Busch Maggie in the bush.

    "sensory-quality": "Nigella seeds have little odour, but when ground or chewed they develop a  vaguely oregano-like scent. The taste is aromatic and slightly bitter; I have seen it called pungent and smoky and even compared to black pepper, but I cannot agree with that comparison.  There is, however, some pungency in unripe or not yet dried seeds.

    "main-constituents": "The seeds contain numerous esters of structurally unusual unsaturated fatty acids with terpene alcohols (7%);  furthermore, traces of alkaloids are found which belong to two different types: iso­chinoline al­kaloids are repre­sented by nigellimin and nigellimin-N-oxide, and pyrazol alkaloids include nigellidin and nigellicin.  In  the essential  oil (avr. 0.5%, max. 1.5%), thymo­quinone was identified as the main component (up to 50%) besides p-cymene (40%), α-pinene (up to 15%), di­thymo­quinone and thymo­hydroquinone. Other terpene derivatives were found only in trace amounts: Carvacrol, carvone, limonene, 4-terpineol, citronellol. Further­more, the essential oil contains significant (10%) amounts of fatty acid ethyl esters. On storage, thymo­quinone yields di­thymo­quinone and higher oligo­condensation products (nigellone).  The seeds also contain a fixed oil rich in unsaturated fatty acids, mainly linoleic acid (50 – 60%), oleic acid (20%), eicodadienoic acid (3%) and dihomo­linoleic acid (10%) which is charac­teristic for the genus. Saturated fatty acids (palmitic, stearic acid) amount to about 30% or less.  Commercial nigella oil (Black Seed Oil, Black Cumin Oil) may also contain parts of the essential oil, mostly thymo­quinone, by which it acquires an aromatic flavour. ",
    "origin": "Probably Western Asia. Although nigella is not mentioned in the common Bible translations, there is good evidence that an obscure plant name mentioned in the Old Testament means nigella; if true, this would indicate that nigella is cultivated since far more than two millennia (see pomegranate). Today, the plant is cultivated from Egypt to India. ",

All of these are best used fresh, but since the fresh herb is available only for those with their own garden, the dried herb is also common. Its aroma is still satisfactory. The seeds contain even more essential oil (about 1%) and are chiefly used because of their vermifuge powers (see below). ",
    "plant-family": "Chenopodi­aceae (goose-foot family). ",
    "sensory-quality": "Epazote’s fragrance is strong, but difficult to describe. People would often compare it with (in no particular order) citrus, petroleum, savory, mint or putty. I think it smells like epazote.  Note that there are different chemotypes; I have seen plants that indeed posses a refreshing citrus odour (see also lemon myrtle for a survey of  lemon-scented plants), but in my regular plants I could not find any citrus quality (others could, amazingly, before I told them what the plant was supposed to smell like).           Epazote inflorescence           Epazote plants  ",
    "main-constituents": "All aerial plant parts contain an essential oil (0.7% in the leaves, 2.5% in the unripe fruits) which is composed of various mono­terpenoids (α-pinene, α-phell­andrene, thymol, myrcene, p-cymene, terpinene, campher, trans-isocarveol) and ascaridole, a mono­terpenoid peroxide. Oils from Latin American plants often contain com­paratively less ascaridole (10%), while some mono­terpenoids (limonene, trans-isocarveol, α-pinene, α-phell­andren) may reach levels of 30% and more; this results in a less intensive, but complex flavour. On the other side, plants grown in Europe or Asia have a much stronger taste due to the high levels of ascaridol (70%, one source even states 86%).  Ascaridol (1,4-peroxido-p-menth-2-ene) is rather an uncommon constituent in the essential oils of of spices; another plant owing much of its character to this monoterpene peroxide is boldo. Ascaridole is toxic and has a pungent, not very pleasant flavour; in pure form, it is an explosive sensitive to shock. ",
    "origin": "The plant is indigenous to Central and Southern México, but is today a common neophyte in the warmer parts of Europe and the US. I have found it quite frequently in various mountains in Sri Lanka, Nepal and India (Western Ghats, Nilgiri, Himalaya), but despite it remarkable pungency, it seems to get unnoticed by the local population. ",
    "etymology": "The English genus name, goose-foot, is a translation of the scientific genus name Chenopodium: Greek chen [χήν] goose and pous [πούς] foot; it is motivated by the threelobed leaf shape characteristic of several plants belonging to this group. The alternate genus name Teloxys also refers to leaf shape; in that case, the pointed ends of the leaves enshrouding the inflorescence are indicated (Greek telos [τέλος] end, purpose and oxys [ὀξύς] sharp, acidic, acute).           Epazote flowering plant           Epazote (flowering tip)   The species name ambrosioides ambrosia-like probably refers to the strong odour. Ambrosia [Ἀμβροσία] is, according to Greek mythology, a  nourishment reserved for the Olympic gods, as is implied by its name: a- [ἀ-] (negation, cognate with English un-) and brotos [βρότος] mortal (earlier mrotos [μρότος], cf. murder, all from the Proto-Indo–European root MR̥TO dead). Both conceptually and etymologically, Greek ambrosia [ἀμβροσία] is closely related to Indian amrita [अमृता].  A very closely related variety (var. anthelminticum) is cultivated in the Southern States of the US for its potency against intestinal worms; thus the name wormseed for the plant. To prevent confusion, the variety used in the kitchen (var. ambrosioides) is usually called epazote in English. This name is taken from Náhuatl, the tongue spoken by the Aztecs before the arrival of the Spanish; it is still a minority language in  México and in use among the Indios living around México City. The Náhuatl name of the plant, epazōtl, is due to the potent smell of the herb, which many find disagreeable (epatl skunk and tzotl sweat, dirt, excrement).  A rather different attitude towards epazote’s aroma (or a different aroma in a cooler climate, see also southernwood for a similar phenomenon) is made clear by the Scandinavian names: Finnish saitruunasavikka, Swedish  citronmålla and Norwegian  sitronmelde contain the name of lemon as first  element. As second element, we find in the Finnish name the name of the  botanical genus (goosefoot) and  in both the Swedish and the  Norwegian the  name of the closely related genus Atriplex (orach), which is not distinguished from Chenopodium  in these tongues. The word melde or målla is related to English mill and has in  many Germanic languages relatives meaning flour and grind; several species  of genus Atriplex show a pale green, somewhat dusty leaf surface, as if covered by a layer of fine flour.  In quite many languages, that spice is termed tea, referring to the use as a substitute for true tea in preparing aromatic infusions. For example, we have German Jesuitentee and Spanish té de los jesuitas Jesuit’s tea, Catalan te fals  false tea and several names meaning tea of México (French thé du Mexique, Turkish Meksika çayı).           Epazote plant www.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de   Tea is the dried foliage of the plant Camellia sinensis, which was first used to prepare aromatic infusions in China. The main types are green tea (lü cha [绿茶]) and the fer­mented black tea (hong cha [紅茶], literally red tea); half-fer­mented tea is known as oolong tea (wu long cha [烏龍茶], literally black dragon).  Oolongs may feature surprising flavours, from chocolate to nutty to fruity; my personal favourite is the milk-flavoured golden lily tea (naixiang jinxuan cha [奶香金萱茶]) from Taiwan which has a distinct, creamy strawberry note. Another favourite is the famous hyacinth-scented tie guanyin cha [鐵觀音茶] iron Guanyin tea from Fujian. Guan-yin is the name of that Lady whom the Vietnamese name Quan Am [Quan Âm] and is and often referred to as the Goddess of Mercy. She is identified with the (male) Boddhisatva of Mercy, Avalokiteshvara [अवलोकितेश्वर] or Chenresig [སྤྱན་རས་གཟིགས་].  Since more than a millennium, the word tea is written 茶 in Chinese, which has become the source of the names of tea in almost all contemporary languages.  The etymology of tea becomes slightly complicated, however, by the presence of two groups of names exemplified by the modern English name tea and the older term chaa.  In the Mandarin, the Northern dialect of Chinese, the logograph 茶 tea is pronounced as cha; consequently, this form was borrowed by languages spoken in those countries that imported their tea by inland traffic via the silk route, which originated from the Northern region of China. Examples are Tibetan cha [ཇ་], Hindi and Urdu cha [चा, چاء] or chay [चाय, چاۓ, چائے], Farsi chay [چای], Arabic shay [شاي], Dhivehi sai [ސައި], Amharic shayi [ሻይ], Tigrinya shahi [ሻሂ], Russian and Macedonian chaj [чай, чај], Georgian chai [ჩაი], Turkish çay, Greek tsai [τσάι], Romanian ceai and Czech čaj.           Flowering epazote           Epazote plant   Some nations neigh­bouring China have similar names for tea: In Thai [ชา], Korean [차] and Japanese [茶, ちゃ], the name is invariably cha. These names might have proceeded also from the Mandarin form or from some other Chinese dialect with similar pro­nunciation of that word. For example, in Cantonese the sign 茶 is pronounced as chah, rather close to the Mandarin form. This Cantonese form probably also underlies Portuguese chá, because Portugal imported its tea from the Cantonese-speaking sea-port Macau.  Yet in most countries where tea entered by seabound trade, the word took a different shape defined by the Amoy (Minnan) dialect, which is spoken in the coastal Fujian province in the East of China and in Taiwan. In that area, the glyph 茶 is pronounced te. Thus, the name of tea is teh in Indonesian and Malay, thee in Dutch and tea in English, where the vowel was originally pronounced as in lay. The Dutch and English forms became the predecessors of most names of tea in the tongues of Western Europe, e. g., French thé, Italian tè, Norwegian, Swedish and Welsh te, Finnish and Estonian tee, Latvian tēja, Yiddish  tey [טײ] and also Hebrew teh [תֵּה]. Also, some South Asian names fall into that pattern, e. g., Sinhala te [තේ] and  Telugu teyaku [తేయాకు] tea.  Some languages have forms of both types, e. g., Kannada chaha [ಚಹಾ] and te [ಟೇ] tea or Tamil chaya [சாய] tea and teyilai [தேயிலை] tea leaf. In Vietnamese, the plant is denoted che [chè] and the beverage tra [trà] (spoken approximately cha in the South).  A few languages feature independent terms for tea, e. g., Lithuanian arbata and Polish herbata, with both indirectly derive from Latin herba herb, medicinal herb. "

    "sensory-qual­ity-": "Almost every­body would agree that the fruits’ aroma is pleasant. It is usually described warm, nutty and spicy; some even find or­ange-like qual­ity in it.          Unripe coriander fruits   There is, how­ever, much dis­agree­ment about the flavour of co­riander leaves, roots and un­ripe fruits: Many people of Euro­pean her­itage find it dis­pleas­ing, soapy, like burnt rubber or even like crushed bed­bugs or the evil-smelling stink bugs living on rose bushes. There are, however, many Euro­peans who enjoy cori­ander leaves, and in Asia, Latin America and Africa, almost every­body loves them. These people would describe coriander leaves as fresh, green, tangy and even citrusy.          Coriander flowers   There is per­manent rumour that the ability to like or dis­like coriander herb (cilantro) is genetically caused. I do not know whether this is true; in any case, the theory might explain that some Euro­peans and North­ern Ameri­cans seem to like it from the beginning while others have a hard time getting used to it. Note, however, that almost the same is true for chile, which is used with discretion in Europe and, until recently, the Unites States, but which is, with some exceptions, much more popular everywhere else; yet I haven’t heard the claim that that is a genetic thing, too.           Coriander flowers           Coriander umbel  Main consti­tuents In the ripe fruits, the con­tent of essen­tial oil is com­parably low (typic­ally, less than 1%); the oil consists mainly of linalool (50 to 60%) and about 20% terpenes (pinenes, γ-ter­pinene, myrcene, camphene, phell­andrenes, α-ter­pinene, limonene, cymene).  In toasted coriander fruits, pyrazines are formed as the main flavour com­pounds (see cumin).          Coriander umbel   The taste of the fresh herb is due to an es­sen­tial oil (0.1%) that is al­most en­tire­ly made up of  ali­phatic al­dehydes with 10 to 16 carbon atoms. One finds both saturated (decanal)  and α,β unsaturated (trans-2-tridecenal) aldehydes; the same aldehydes appear in the unripe fruits.  Similar compounds occur in a few other spices and herbs, all of which share coriander’s flavour: Examples include long coriander, Vietnamese coriander and the Japanese chemotype of chameleon plant. Origin Probably Eastern Mediterranean (Greece) or Asia Minor.             Coriander field            Coriander flowers            Flowering coriander plant   The coriander grown in Russia and Central Europe (var. micr­ocarpum) has smaller fruits (less than 3 mm) and contains more essential oil than the oriental variety var. vulgare (greater than 3 mm), which is cultivated for fruits and leaves. Etymology The names of coriander in all Western European languages can be traced back to Latin coriandrum and Greek koriannon [κορίαννον]. The Greek name exists in several variant forms, e. g., korion [κόριον] in Dioskurides and koriadna [𐀒𐀪𐀊𐀅𐀙] in Mycenaean Greek. It is usually put into relation with koris [κόρις] bug, because of the aroma of the leaves, but it is more probably a loan from an ancient Medi­ter­ra­nean tongue and might be dis­tantly re­lated to Greek karon [κάρον] cumin and Biblical Hebrew gad [גד] co­rian­der.          Coriander flowers   The German names Wanzen­dill (bug’s dill)  and Wanzen­kümmel (bug’s caraway) may be loan trans­lations of the Greek name, but I think they perhaps arose in­depen­dently. The names are clearly deroga­tory and reflect the critical attitude towards coriander leaves common among Central or North Euro­peans.  In Latin America and also in the USA, coriander leaves are commonly known by the name cilantro. This word has the same origin as coriander, and it is difficult to explain the differing  vowel. Maybe cilantro is directly derived from a Latin variant with light vowel, e. g., Medieval Latin  celiandrum. Another explanation claims that the Spanish name was first culantro, later changed to cilantro for some reason; in any case, culantro exists in today’s Mesoamerican Spanish, but usually denotes not coriander but a similar smelling herb, long coriander. Confusingly, on some Caribbean islands, long coriander is known as cilantro and coriander as cilantrillo.          Flowering coriander plant   Many Asian ton­gues have inter­related names for coriander, e. g.,  Indo­nesian ketumbar, Dhivehi kotanbiri [ކޮތަނބިރި], Tamil kota­malli [கொய்த­மல்லி], Telugu kustum­buru [కుస్తుం­బురు], Gujarati kothmir [કોથમીર], Urdu kothamir [کوتھمیر] and Arabic al-kuzbara [الكزبرة]. This group seems to be of ancient origin, as it has members also in Sanskrit (kustumbari [कुस्तुंबरी]) and Akkadian (kisibirru [𒊺𒇽]). Its relation to coriander (if any) is not known.  Another, per­haps related, group of names originating from Middle Persian gishniz is found in Western to Central Asia: Farsi geshniz [گشنیز], Urdu kishniz [کشنیز], Tajik gashnich [гашнич], Uzbek kashnich [кашнич], Azeri keşniş, Turkish kişniş and also Russian kishnets [кишнец]. The names in the Caucasus countries (Georgian kindzi [ქინძი], Ossetian kindzae [киндзӕ] and Armenian kinj [գինձ]) are perhaps related and have been transferred, via Russian kinza [кинза], to some more languages of the Soviet Union (Latvian kinzas). I also suspect Coptic sheshnou [ϣϣⲛⲟⲩ] to belong to that group.  Because of similar shape and usage, coriander leaves are named after parsley, often with a geographic epithet: Indian parsley and Chinese parsley are most often heard. The Hungarian name cigány­petrezselyem gypsies’ parsley should also be named in this context, although I am not sure of the motivation behind.

    "etymology": "The old genus name Poly­gonum (English: knot­weed) refers to the shape of the stem, which is composed of many joints linked together by slightly bent knots or knees: Greek polys [πολύς] many and gony [γόνυ] knee; cf. also English knotweed. The new genus name Persicaria derives from the name of peach (Prunus persica), because of similar leaf shape.  In Singapore, Vietnamese coriander is known as laksa plant (also laksa herb or laksa leaves); in Singaporean Cantonese, there is the equivalent name laksa yip [喇沙葉]. These names reflects the usage of Vietnamese coriander for the Chinese-Malaysian noodle curry laksa, which in turn is apparently named for its many ingredients: The Hindi term lakh [लाख], also often used by Indians when speaking English, means hundred thousand or metonymically many, being  derived from synonymous Sanskrit laksha [लक्ष] or lakshya [लक्ष्य].  The term Vietnamese mint frequently found in English literature is botanic nonsense, as peppermint belongs to a distant plant family, Lamiaceae. "

    "origin": "Origin of all Citrus species is unclear because of their ancient cultivation (see also orange); C. limon is thought native in Central Asia; there is rumour that some wild populations of citron can still be found in Iran.  Today, lemons are cultivated in many tropic or subtropical countries. The USA and México are the main producers; México, due to its tropic climate, mostly accounts for limes. In Europe, most lemons actually stem from Spain or Italy.  Citron is of compara­tively little economic value. It is mostly grown in Sicily, Greece and Corsica.              Three-leaved lemon, Poncirus trifoliata, flower. Because it is largely frost-tolerant, this species is often grafted with the more delicate edible citrus cultivars.

    "etymology": "Citrus is, in last con­sequence, derived from Greek kedromelon [κεδρο­μῆλον] apple of cedar (Greek melon [μῆλον] is cognate to Latin malum apple); this name, however, did not signify  lemon, but citron whose culti­vation in Egypt is reported by Greek travel­lers.  The Romans, then, shortened the Greek name to citrus.  Names for lemon in a large number of European tongues derive from Latin citrus, e. g., German Zitrone, French citron, Finnish sitruuna, Latvian citrons, Czech citrón, Polish cytryna, Hungarian citrom, Yiddish zitstrin [זיצטרין] and Armenian gidron [կիտրոն], all of which mean lemon. Some languages have similar names for the more ancient fruit, citron, which should not be confused with lemon: Croatian četrun, Polish cytron, French cédrat, \tItalian cedro, Russian tsedrat [цедрат] and Greek kitro [κίτρο].  English lemon, and a number of other names for that fruit, derive from Arabic al-limun [الليمون] lemon; see lime for more. The botanical species epithet of citron, medicus, alludes to the Medes, a Persian tribe, who are supposed to have introduced citron to the Mediterranean countries. This is modelled on the Classical Greek name of citron, melea he Medike [μηλέα ἡ Μηδική] Median apple (also melea he Persike [μηλέα ἡ Περσική] Persian apple) for citron. There is no etymological connection to medicine (the Linnean species epithet for that would have been medicinalis), which derives from the same root as measure and meter.           Citron fruit (ornamental) www.desert-tropicals.com           Buddha’s hands, an ornamental citron variety www.zitrusgaertnerei.de           Edible citron http://www.isolotto.com   The some­what puzzeling German name Zitronat­zitrone  citron is a simple tatpuru­sha com­pound (prim­ary word Zitrone le­mon, deter­mina­tive  ele­ment Zitronat suc­cade) mean­ing lemon whose peel is used for making suc­cade; the same holds for Hun­garian cédrát­citrom, and also Finnish sukaatti seems to be derived from suc­cade. In Dutch, citron is called muskus­citroen musky lemon; see nut­meg on the word musk.  I was not able to find a definitive etymology for the term succade candied citron peel. I guess that it is derived from Hebrew sukkot or sukoth [סוכות] which refers to the Jewish Feast of Taber­nacles, a religious rite involving, among others, citron fruit (etrog [אתרוג]) and myrtle branches (hadas [הדס]). Some sources, however, trace the name back to Latin succus juice. A third possibility is to relate succade to sugar or a cognate (e. g., French sucre). Names of sugar in almost all European tongues come, via Old Italian zucchero, Late Latin saccharum, Greek sakcharon [σάκχαρον] and Persian shakar (today Farsi shakar [شکر]) from Sanskrit sharkara [शर्करा] sugar, which originally meant pebbles or grit and was also used to denote crystallized sugar, which was a genuine Indian invention.  In India, lemon is not much known, as the tropcal climate favours lime as the sour citrus fruit. Yet, in the Himalaya, true lemon is grown together with lime. The two fruits are both called nimbu in Hindi; if desired, a distinction can be made between bara nimbu [बड़ा निंबू] big nimbu (lemon) and chota nimbu [छोटा निंबू] small nimbu (lime). Lemon-like fruits are also found in North-Eastern India: In the Khasi and Garo Hills, and in the states bordering Burma. "

Main con­stituents The essential oil of lemon grass (0.2 to 0.5%, West Indian lemon grass oil) consists mainly of citral. Further terpenoids in lemon grass oil are nerol, limonene, linalool and β-caryo­phyllene. The content of myrcene is low, but still enough to make the oil sus­cept­ible to oxida­tive poly­meri­za­tion.  Citral is a mixture of two stereo­isomeric mono­terpene alde­hydes; in lemon grass oil, the trans isomer geranial (40 to 62%) domi­nates over the cis isomer neral (25 to 38%).  East Indian lemon grass oil is distilled from a related species, C. flexuosus. It consists of alcohols (20 to 30% citronellol, geraniol) and aldehydes (15% geranial, 10% neral, 5% citronellal).

Also worth mentioning is citronella grass  (Cymbopogon winterianus Jowitt) which also stems from India, but is today grown throughout the tropics; its main constituents are citronellal (35%), geraniol (25%) and citronellol (10%) plus minor amounts of geranyl acetate (5%).

The so-called East-Indian lemon grass (Cymbo­pogon flexuosus [Nees ex Steudel] J.F. Watson) is native to India, Sri Lanka, Burma and Thai­land; for the related West-Indian lemon grass (C. citratus [DC] Stapf), a Malesian origin is generally as­sumed.

Base of the stem of lemon grass           Lemon grass plant   Although the two species can almost be used inter­change­ably, C. citratus is more rele­vant for cooking. In India, it is culti­vated as a medical herb and for per­fumes, but not used as a spice; in the rest of tropical Asia (mostly South East Asia, more mar­ginally in Sri Lanka), it is an impor­tant culi­nary herb and spice.           Lemon gras stems           Lemon grass plant  Etymology The botanical genus name Cymbo­pogon is derived from Greek kymbe [κύμβη] boat and pogon [πώγων] beard; it refers to the boat-shaped spathes and the many-eared inflores­cences which re­mind to a beard.  The species name citratus obviously relates to the pro­minent lemon fra­grance of that plant. Similarly, most Euro­pean names of lemon grass are either adapted from local names of lemon (citro­nella) or are com­pounds meaning lemon herb (Finnish sitruuna­ruoho, Portuguese  erva-cidreira, Turkish limon otu, Chinese ning meng xiang mao [檸檬香茅] lemon-flavoured plant) or particularly often lemon-grass (Danish citrongræs, Lithuanian citrinžolė, Czech citrónová tráva, Estonian sidrunhein, Hungarian citromfű). Similar compounds are Russian limonnoe sorgo [лимонное сорго] lemon-sorghum and Spanish te de limón lemon tea. The various names of lemon are further explained under lemon and lime.  Arabic hashisha al-limun [حشيشة الليمون] contains hashish [حشيش] grass, which is known as a euphemistic term for cannabis in the West. The arabic name for water pipe, shisha [شيشة], may be related, although others derive it from Farsi shisheh [شیشه] glass in reference to the material the pipe is made from. The latter would be analogous to Persian nargileh (see coconut for its derivation).           Lemon grass plant           Leaves of lemon grass   The English word grass and its Latin cognate gramen (from older grasmen) (grass)-blade, stalk can­not be ex­plained easily. It is probably con­nected to an Proto-Indo–European­pean root re­fer­ring to plant growth (GʰREH₂ or GʰRĒ project out, sprout, grow, with grow and green as close English kin); in German, the basic meaning is pre­served in Grat ridge, crest and Gräte fish bone. On the other hand, given the impor­tance of grass as an animal fodder, it is hardly co­inci­den­tal that a similar Proto-Indo–European­pean root, GRAS, means devour, digest (see cress for more infor­mation on this root).  The medi­eval English name squinant is a cor­ruption of earlier schoenanth and derives from two Greek words, schoinos [σχοῖνος] rush, grass (see also chives) and anthos [ἄνθος] flower.  Another name of that period is Dutch kamelhewe and Yiddish kemlhey [קעמלהײ] camel’s hay which refers to the caravans that transported dried lemongrass on the back of camels from tropical Asia to Europe (spice route). Lemon grass was used for beer brewing (see gale) and preparation of spiced wines.  It is an open question whether lemon grass was already known in antiquity, as many aromatics of ancient texts have not yet been identified. A possible candidate is the Biblical qaneh [קָנֶה] which appears to denote a kind of grassy plant or reed; if often occurs in the meaning branch.  Yet on some occasions, it is listed among aromatics (e. g., in the Song of Songs) and there are not so many grass-shaped aromatic plants to chose from. Conservative wisdom has it translated calamus, but lemon grass would also appear a possibility.

    "etymology": "The botanical genus name Cymbo­pogon is derived from Greek kymbe [κύμβη] boat and pogon [πώγων] beard; it refers to the boat-shaped spathes and the many-eared inflores­cences which re­mind to a beard.  The species name citratus obviously relates to the pro­minent lemon fra­grance of that plant. Similarly, most Euro­pean names of lemon grass are either adapted from local names of lemon (citro­nella) or are com­pounds meaning lemon herb (Finnish sitruuna­ruoho, Portuguese  erva-cidreira, Turkish limon otu, Chinese ning meng xiang mao [檸檬香茅] lemon-flavoured plant) or particularly often lemon-grass (Danish citrongræs, Lithuanian citrinžolė, Czech citrónová tráva, Estonian sidrunhein, Hungarian citromfű). Similar compounds are Russian limonnoe sorgo [лимонное сорго] lemon-sorghum and Spanish te de limón lemon tea. The various names of lemon are further explained under lemon and lime.  Arabic hashisha al-limun [حشيشة الليمون] contains hashish [حشيش] grass, which is known as a euphemistic term for cannabis in the West. The arabic name for water pipe, shisha [شيشة], may be related, although others derive it from Farsi shisheh [شیشه] glass in reference to the material the pipe is made from. The latter would be analogous to Persian nargileh (see coconut for its derivation).           Lemon grass plant           Leaves of lemon grass   The English word grass and its Latin cognate gramen (from older grasmen) (grass)-blade, stalk can­not be ex­plained easily. It is probably con­nected to an Proto-Indo–European­pean root re­fer­ring to plant growth (GʰREH₂ or GʰRĒ project out, sprout, grow, with grow and green as close English kin); in German, the basic meaning is pre­served in Grat ridge, crest and Gräte fish bone. On the other hand, given the impor­tance of grass as an animal fodder, it is hardly co­inci­den­tal that a similar Proto-Indo–European­pean root, GRAS, means devour, digest (see cress for more infor­mation on this root).  The medi­eval English name squinant is a cor­ruption of earlier schoenanth and derives from two Greek words, schoinos [σχοῖνος] rush, grass (see also chives) and anthos [ἄνθος] flower.  Another name of that period is Dutch kamelhewe and Yiddish kemlhey [קעמלהײ] camel’s hay which refers to the caravans that transported dried lemongrass on the back of camels from tropical Asia to Europe (spice route). Lemon grass was used for beer brewing (see gale) and preparation of spiced wines.  It is an open question whether lemon grass was already known in antiquity, as many aromatics of ancient texts have not yet been identified. A possible candidate is the Biblical qaneh [קָנֶה] which appears to denote a kind of grassy plant or reed; if often occurs in the meaning branch.  Yet on some occasions, it is listed among aromatics (e. g., in the Song of Songs) and there are not so many grass-shaped aromatic plants to chose from. Conservative wisdom has it translated calamus, but lemon grass would also appear a possibility.

    "origin": "In con­trast to the more sub­tropical lemon, lime requires tropical climate. It probably stems from South­east Asia, where many more related species grow wild (e.g, kaffir lime).  Today, many dif­ferent lime varie­ties are known and culti­vated. Small-fruited culti­vars are often more aro­matic; in the US, they are called key limes, since they are (or were) grown on Key West. Limes cultivated in tropical Asia have similar fruits: They are small, spherical and rather smooth. Large-fruited cultivars (Tahiti, Bearss) are often regarded inferior.  Lime juice resembles lemon juice it its content in citric acid (8%), but it contains much less ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) than the latter.             Lime twig with prickles            Unripe lime on tree            Ripening limes           Ripening lime  Etymology On the botanical genus name Citrus, see lemon. The species name auranti­folius orange-leaved is derived from an outdated botanical name of orange, Citrus aurantium.  The English term lime has many relatives in other European languages, for example German Limette, Dutch limoen, Polish limetka, Italian lima or limetta, French limon or limette, Greek and Hebrew  laim [λάιμ, ליים] and also Japanese raimu [ライム]. Yet very similar names exist in some languages for the lemon, e. g., English lemon, Portuguese limão, Italian limone, Croatian limun, Slovenian limona, Albanian and Georgian limoni [ლიმონი], Bulgarian and Hebrew limon [лимон, לימון] and also Japanese remon [れもん, レモン].  All these names originate from Arabic limun [ليمون] and Persian limou [لیمو] lemon which can both also be used for limes (the two fruits have a long and not yet finished history of mutual confusion). The further origin of the word is dark, but one can safely assume a connection to Sanskrit nimbu [निंबू] or nimbuka [निंबूक] lime; some have also assumed a derivation from Chinese ning-meng [檸檬] lemon, but this itself looks rather like a loanword to me.  Limes, being essentially tropical fruits, have not much of a tradition in Europe; thus, their name is often formed from the name of lemon by adding an adjective reflecting some typical property of lime: Yiddish grine limene [גרינע לימענע] and Romanian lămâie verde green lemon, Spanish limón agria sour lemon, Turkish tatlı limon sweet lemon, and Romanian lămâi mexican Mexican lemon. I am unable to explain the motivation behind the Turkish name.  In India, the tropical climate favours lime as the sour citrus fruit over lemon, a much less known fruit. Yet, in the Himalaya, both lemon and lime may grown side by side. The two fruits are both called nimbu in Hindi; if desired, a distinction can be made between bara nimbu [बड़ा निंबू] big nimbu (lemon) and chota nimbu [छोटा निंबू] small nimbu (lime). I have also seen lime being referred to as lebu [लेबु], a name probably not valid outside of the mountain dialect (Pahari) of Hindi.          Ripening limes           Ripening lime   The English name lime must  not be con­fused with its homo­nym meaning calcium oxide (a building material  produced from lime­stone, calcium carbonate), which is related to loam  or slime and derives from an Proto-Indo–European root (S)LEI with general meaning  smear, glue (cf. German Lehm clay). Lime stone is not often used for culinary purposes, Mexican masa harina (tortilla flour) and South-East Asian betel bits being the only appli­cations I know of.  By chance, English lime (or linden) has yet another meaning, refer­ring to the trees of genus Tilia (Malvaceae). Cf. for example the half-line lind wið lige the linden (=the wooden shield) against the fire (of the dragon) in the Beowulf poem.  That name linden has co­gnates in Germanic, Baltic and Sla­vonic tongues, e. g., Lithua­nian liepa, Norwegian lind, Czech lípa and Russian lipa [липа]. It is probably derived from an Proto-Indo–Euro­pean root LENT flexible, referring to the soft wood of linden trees often used for wood-carving. Cf. also Latin lentus flexible, slow, Polish lęt whip, Sanskrit lata [लता] creeping plant and Old Norse linni snake, German Lindwurm dragon.

Lauric (dodecanoic acid;  40 to 55%) and myristic acid (tetradecanoic acid; 15 to 20%) dominate, but several other fatty acids are found at concentrations of 5 to 10%: The two short-chain acids caprylic (octanoic) and capric (decanoic) acid (which are responsible for the smell of overaged coconut oil), the long-chain palmitic acid (hexadecanoic acid) and oleic acid, which is the only unsaturated fatty acid found at significant amounts. Consequently, the iodine index is very low (typically, below 10). See also sesame on the topic of plant oils.           Coconut palm           Coconuts are sometimes sold with the hard shell removed   The typical coconut flavour is caused by several δ-lactones of aliphatic hydroxy-carboxylic acids, ranging in chain length from 8 to 14; 5-decan­olide (5-pentyl­oxan-2-one) is the most important single compound. Synthetic coconut flavourings often contain a homologous γ-lactone, 4-nonan­olide (pentyl­oxolan-2-one), which is not found in coconuts. Toasting coconuts leads to pyrolysis of maltose and glucose, whereby  new fragrant compounds are formed: maltol (2-hydroxy 3-methyl γ-pyrone) and cyclotene (cyclopentenolone, 2-hydroxy 3-methyl 2-cyclopenten-1-one), respectively. Furthermore, a great number of alkylpyrazines were identified (pyrazine, methyl pyrazin, dimethyl pyrazines, vinyl pyrazin, isopropyl pyrazin).          Coconuts are sometimes sold with the hard shell removed  Origin The coconut tree stems from the Southeast Asian peninsular (probably Malaysia), but is cultivated in tropical regions all around the world. Older books often speculate about a Polynesian or even American origin of coconut, but recent developments have shown this view almost certainly wrong. In all probability, the coconut tree was first cultivated by peoples of India or Southeast Asia; emigrants from these countries then introduced the coconut tree to almost everywhere in the tropics of Asia and Oceania. There is no proof of coconuts having grown in America before the arrival of the Spaniards; this is curious, however, since the closest relatives of the coconut palm are of American distribution.

The botanical species name nucifera is a neo-Latin formation meaning  bearing nuts (nux nut and ferre bring, carry, bear).  Almost all names of coconut in Indic languages are related, e. g., Hindi nariyal [नारियल], Urdu nariyel  [ناریل], Punjabi narial [ਨਾਰੀਅਲ], Gujarati nariyel [નારિયેળ], Marathi naral [नारळ], Bengali narokel [নারকেল] and Telugu narikelamu [నారికేళము]; cf. also Mongolian nargil [наргил]. These and other names go back to Sanskrit narikela [नारीकेल], whose origin, however, is not Indo–European. The first element resembles several Austro­nesian names of coconut, e. g., Tagalog niyog, Malaysian nyiur and Hawaiian niu. In Tamil, the related word ney [நெய்] has the generalized meaning semi-solid fat, paralleling similar constructions for other oilseeds (olive, sesame).  Farsi has a related name for coconut, nargil [نارگیل], which lies behind the Persian term nargileh [نارگیله] for water pipe, since coconut shells can be used as pipe bowl. The word entered many languages as an exotism for oriental tobacco pipes.  Some names of coconut, e. g.

    "main-constituents": "Similar to many other members of the cabbage family (black and white mustard, horseradish, wasabi, rocket), all cresses owe their aroma to isothiocyanates. The isothiocyanates are formed from inactive precursors called glucosinolates as a reaction to injuries.           Garden cress flowers           Garden cress flowering top   Water and gar­den cress contain gluco­nasturtiin, which yields the 2-phenyl­ethyl iso­thiocyanate (C6H5–CH2–CH2–NCS). In contrast, the pungency of nasturtium leaves comes from benzyl iso­thiocynate, (C6H5–CH2–NCS), which is created from gluco­tropaeolin (benzyl glucos­inolate); yet in nasturtium seeds, another glucosinolate was found (gluco­putranjivin), which yields isopropyl isothiocyanate on enzymatic hydrolysis. Benzyl isothiocyanate is  closely related to the pungent principle of white mustard, but much more volatile and, thus, less persistent.  Since all these isothiocyantes are volatile and much susceptible to heat and moisture,  cress aroma is most delicate; thus, cress leaves are always used fresh, never  dried,  and should not be boiled, baked or otherwise heated.

    "origin": "Garden cress probably stems from West­ern or Cen­tral Asia, where it is still found in the wild state. It is easy to culti­vate and tol­er­ates nearly every climate.  The cosmo­politan water cress  is similar in taste and can, thus, be sub­stituted by ordinary garden cress; its aroma, how­ever, is some­times de­scribed su­pe­rior to other cress species. Although water cress was one of the herbs which Charle­magne or­dered to be grown in Im­perial gardens (see lovage), it is not grown com­mer­cial­ly in our days. It might be available on markets, either from small-scale back­yard culti­vation of from collections in the wild.  Nasturtium stems from Southern America, probably Perú, and was introduced to Europe by Spanish conquistadores. It is a common ornamental, but less used for cooking. ",
    "etymology": "The Greeks knew a plant with pungent leaves which was of Persian origin; also the Greek name of that plant, kardamon [κάρδαμον], was a loan from the con­tempo­rary lan­guage of Persia. Though the exact botan­ical re­lations are un­clear, that word has sur­vived, in the form of kar­damo [κάρ­δαμο], as the New Greek name of garden cress (yet car­damom has the same name!). Cf. also the botan­ical name of the related genus Car­damine (bitter cress), which con­tains the Cuckoo Flower or Lady’s Smock, Car­damine pratense.            Garden cress in Nepal            Garden cress    English cress (from Old English cærse) is not related to that. Instead, it is usually put into relation with the other­wise iso­lated Latvian griezīgs sharp; another theory derives it from the Proto-Indo–European root GRAS devour whence also  Old Norse kras delicacy, Sanskrit grasati [ग्रसति] he eats, Greek gran [γρᾶν] gnaw. See also the etymo­logy of grass  (lemon grass).  Comparatively few lan­gu­ages take the ob­vious choice to name cress as pepper-grass or pepper-herb, e. g., Yid­dish fefer­gros [פֿעפֿערגראָס], Hun­garian bors­fű and Japanese koshō-sō [胡椒草, こしょうそう, コショウソウ]. Only the third one is really a standard name, the former two are more regional variants. Possibly, also Georgian c’ic’mat’i [წიწმატი] has a similar back­ground (c’ic’ak’a [წიწაკა] chile). Note that some languages have a name of pepper-herb type that refers to savory; in Hun­garian, borsfű  may actu­ally de­note both plants.           Water cress           Water cress plant (Nasturtium officinale) © Birgit Wende   The classical Latin name nas­turtium (used by the Romans for several cress-like plants, mostly garden cress) probably derives from nasi-tortium nose pain (from nasus nose and the verb torquere torment) and refers to the sharp, pungent aroma. The term Nasturtium has become the botani­cal genus name for water cress; yet, in English, it is common­ly used for Tropaeolum, a plant of new-world origin that was ob­vious­ly un­known to the Ro­mans. Clearly, this is a source of confusion.  Water cress bears, in most lan­guages, an attribute meaning water (Indo­nesian air, Finnish vesi, German Wasser, Italian acqua, Russian voda [вода], Greek nero [νερό]) or well; fountain (German Brunnen, French fontaine), referring to its frequent growth in silent water.  About the etymology of water, see water pepper.           Nasturtium flowers (Tropaeolum majus) www.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de   Some names of nas­turtium relate to its origin from Latin America, e. g., French cresson d’Inde or Swedish indian­krasse (Ameri­can) In­dian cress. These names, however, should not be confused with designations like Brazil cress which refer to a culinarily distinct plant commonly known as paracress.          Water cress plant (Nasturtium officinale) © Birgit Wende   Other names of nasturtium refer to its import by members of Catholic Christian orders, e. g., Turkish  lâtin çiçeği Latin flower Bulgarian latinka [латин­ка] and Kurdish ladan [لادةن]; in these names, Latin hints not at the language but alludes to Rome as the center of the Roman Catholic Church. Names like German Kapuziner­kresse, French capucine, Dutch capuciener­kers, Italian cappuccina, Arabic nabat al-kabbusin [نبات الكبوسين] and Russian kaputsin-kress [капуцин-кресс] are motivated by the same association with Catholic monks, and in addition by the similar shapes of nasturtium flowers and the cowl of Capuchin monks. The name of the Capuchin order derive from  Italian cappuccio hood; especially a monk’s cowl, related to English cap. The same motive is found in Hebrew kova ha-nazir [כובע הנזיר] monk's cap and gargir ha-nazir גרגיר הנזיר monk cresss.           Nasturtium flowers (Tropaeolum majus) www.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de   The botanical genus name of nas­turtium, Trop­aeolum, was coined from Greek tropaion [τρόπαιον or τροπαῖον] trophy, by which the an­cients meant parts of the de­feated enemy’s armour pub­lic­ly dis­played as a sign of vic­tory. The re­ference is both to the shield-formed leaves and the flowers which resemble a helmet if viewed from the side. Tropaion itself derives from trope [τροπή] change, turning (also the turning point when a fight is lost) and is thus related to many English words like tropic (the parallels of latitude where the sun turns from the zenith) or catastrophe (the moment when fate turns to evil). The Proto-Indo–European root behind that word is TREP turn.  English speakers, beware: Since Nasturtium is  the botanical name of water cress and not of the plant commonly called nasturtium, there is much room for confusion. Especially, gluconasturtiin does not occur in nasturtium!

Main components are the phenols thymol (ca. 40%) and carvacrol (ca. 15%). In winter, phenol content is lower (but mostly thymol); in summer, more phenols (up to 70%) are found, with significant amounts of carvacrol. Further components in the essential oil are thymol methyl ether (2%), cineol, cymene, α-pinene, borneol and esters of the latter two.  Lemon thyme, Thymus x citriodorus, was found to contain an essential oil rich in geraniol (up to 60%); other compounds identified include geranyl esters, nerol and citronellol.  The lemon fragrance is due to citral (14%), and thymol was found in small (0.5%) yet not insignificant amounts. (Flavour Fragrance Journal, 10,  225, 1995)  The main components in Th. serpyllum (grown in Uttarakhand, Northern India) were found to be thymol and its methyl ether. (National Academy Science Letters, 35, 445, 2012) There is also a Thymus species native to that area (Th. linearis), whose essential contains thymol (60%), p-cymene (10%) and γ-terpinene (6%), with large variation in percentages.

Mastic thyme, also known as Spanish wild marjoram (Th.  mastichina)           Orange thyme in full flower   Of the many further species of the genus Thymus, only Th. zygis (Spanish Thyme) is an accepted substitute. Its essential oil is low in thymol methyl ether (less than 0.5%), which is important for the characterization. The other species (Th. satureoides, Th. mastichina, Th. broussonetti, Th. maroccanus, Th. pallidus and Th. algeriensis) are considered inferior, because of their lower content of thymol and because some of them contain other aroma components, especially carvacrol (see savory). Th. serpyllum  (continental wild thyme, a mountain plant of temperate Europe) has only local  value as spice; its flowers are used to prepare a syrup with strong thyme fragrance. Most unusually, Th. herba–barona almost perfectly copies the scent of caraway.  Another cultivar sometimes found in markets is orange thyme (Th. vulgaris var. odoratissimus) with strong thyme fragrance and a hint of orange peel aroma.  Lastly, lemon thyme (Th. citriodorus = Th. pulegoides × Th. vulgaris) exhibits an unusual flavour, combining thyme aroma with the fragrance of lemons,  but is little traded; it is best when fresh. Lemon thyme fits perfect to fish and fruity vegetables; see lemon myrtle about lemon fragrance. ",
    "etymology": "The name thyme is borrowed from Latin thymus, which goes back to Greek thymon [θύμον] thyme. The Greek plant name is usually put in relation with thymos [θυμός] spirit, originally meaning smoke (related to Latin fumus smoke; cf. perfume) and the verb thyein [θύειν] smoke, cure; offer an incense sacrifice. The reference is probably the strong, smoky odour of thyme. Yet there is also another, unrelated explanation that the Greek name actually comes from Old Egyptian tham, which denoted a plant used in the mummification process.           Th. willdenowii from North Africa           Continental wild thyme, Th. serpyllum   Most Euro­pean languages have related names all deriving from Latin thymus. Examples are German Thymian, Italian timo, Finnish timjami, Estonian tüümian, Dutch tijm, Russian timyan [тимьян], Greek thimari [θυμάρι] and Hebrew timin [תימין].  In some Balto-Slavic tongues, however, one can find a group of unrelated names that reminds of local designations for savory: Romanian cimbru, Lithuanian čiobreliai and Russian chabrets [чабрец]. Another group of names in Slavonic languages, exemplified by Czech mateřídouška and Bulgarian mashterka [мащерка], appears to derive from a local term for mother, but I do not know the details.  On the German name of creeping thyme, Quendel, see savory. English creeping thyme and Swedish kryptimian both refer to the shrub’s creeping shape. A similar association lies behind French serpolet, Italian serpillo, Basque txerpol and others: These derive via Latin serpullum from the Greek plant name herpyllos [ἕρπυλλος] which in turn is related to Greek herpein [ἕρπειν] and Latin serpere creep (cf. serpent, literally the creeping one). The botanical species name serpyllum is a compromise between both the Greek and Latin forms. Yiddish feldkiml [פֿעלדקימל] field caraway appears motivated by the scent reminding to caraway. "

After­wards, the coumarin content may be as high as 10%. Coumarin crystals are visible below the epidermis of the seed.  Coumarin glycosides occur in several plants; on wilting or drying, coumarin is liberated. For example, coumarin contributes to the pleasant smell of fresh dried hay. Woodruff (Asperula odorata) has high coumarin content and  is sometimes used to flavour alcoholic drinks in Western Europe and the US. It has come out of use, though.  Coumarin is toxic and causes serious though reversible liver damage in high dosages or if applied regularly over some time; toxic doses range around one gram, but some individuals are more suceptible. In rodents, coumarin has proven a carcinogen, yet this result does probably not hold for humans. It should be noted that some condensed coumarin derivatives act as strong antagonists to vitamin K and thus prevent blood coagulation; these compounds are used as rodenticides and as medicinal anticoagulants. Simple coumarin does not show this effect (but some molds can metabolize it to vitamin K blockers, which is why moldy hay may cause fatal poisoning in cattle).

The old genus name, Coumarouna,  was formed from another Tupi name of the tonka tree, kumarú.  The latter also lies behind the name of  tonka’s main constituent,  coumarin.  The modern genus name is Greek (dis-  prefix double- from dyo [δύο] two; pteryx [πτέρυξ] wing) and refers to the special two-winged  shape of the fruits.

    "main-con­stituents": "The intensive colour of saffron is caused by pigments of carot­enoid type. Although saffron contains some con­ventional carot­enoids (α- and β-carotene, lycopin and zea­xanthin), its staining capability is mostly caused by crocetine esters; crocetin is a dicarboxylic acid with a carotenoid-like C18 backbone which is formed from carotenoid precursors (diterpene carotenoid). Crocin, a diester of crocin with gentobiose, is the single most important saffron pigment.  In the essential oil (max. 1%), several terpene aldehydes and ketones are found.  The most abundant constituent is safranal, 2,6,6-trimethyl 1,3-cyclo­hexadiene-1-carbaldehyde  (50% and more); another olfactorily important compound is 2-hydroxy 4,4,6-trimethyl 2,5-cyclo­hexadien-1-one. Further­more, terpene derivatives have been identified (pinene, cineol).  The bitter taste is attributed to picrocrocin, the glucoside of an alcohol structurally related to safranal (4-hydroxy 2,4,4-trimethyl 1-cyclohexene-1-carboxaldehyde ). On de-glucosylation, picrocrocin yields safranal.             Saffron flower with yellow stamina and red stigmata            Saffron threads after harvest © Therese Witzke    Safranal and its relatives, most typically C9 or C10 isoprenoids with a cyclohexane ring, are formed from carotenoid pigments as the result of enzymatic degradation (see also pandanus leaves). Origin Saffron is the triploid form of a species found in Eastern Greece, Crocus cartwrightianus; it probably appeared first in Crete. An origin in Western or Central Asia, although often suspected, has been disproved by botanical research. (Plant. Syst. Evol., 128, 89, 1977)  Because of being triploid, saffron is necessarily sterile, and its beautiful flowers cannot produce any seeds; propagation is possible only via corms. Distribution over larger distance requires human help, and so it’s surprising that saffron was known to the Sumerians almost 5000 years ago. It is not known, however, how the spice was transported from the Medi­terranean to Sumer in Meso­potamia.  Today, saffron is cultivated from the Western Mediterranean (Spain) to India (Kashmir). Spain and Iran are the largest producers, accounting together for more than 80% of the world’s production, which is approximately 300 tons per year.  In Europe, saffron production is almost limited to the Mediterranean; Spanish (La Mancha) saffron is generally considered the best. In much smaller scale, saffron is also cultivated in Italy and Greece (Crete).             Dried saffron in bulk quantity            Saffron flowers in Kashmir            Flowers on a saffron field (India)   Saffron does, however, quite well in cooler climates, and since the 15.th century, numerous attempts have been made to introduce saffron production to German, Switzerland, Austria and even England. For example, the town of Saffron Walden (Essex/England) got its name from local saffron production in the 16.th century. However, by the end of the 18.th century, most of the former saffron cultivation sites had become abandoned, and in our days, the only remaining saffron industry in Europe north of the Mediterranean is found in Mund, a small Swiss village in canton Wallis. In Mund, a few kilograms of saffron per year are produced in traditional way, at an elevation of about 1200 m.   Of the Western and Central Asian cultivation areas, Iran is most productive. In recent years, yield has been enormously increased and Iran now produces more saffron than Spain. Smaller amounts are harvested in Turkey and India.  Of all the Indian provenances, Kashmiri saffron has a particularly high reputation, but is hardly available outside India; furthermore, yields and quality have decreased because of the unfortunate political situation persisting since decades. Production is confined to a small area around the village Pampore [پانپورہ], just a few kilometers from the summer state capital Srinagar. The fields are divided into sections one or two square meters large and are kept free from vegetation all year round. Flowers show up for a about two weeks in the end of October or the beginning of November. They are picked from the plants (to stimulate more flower formation) and separated into styles are waste afterwards. Including the final drying of the styles, all the work is done by families that use little or no modern technology. Etymology  The name saffron comes from Arabic, where the spice is known as az-za'fran [الزعفران]; that name is often explained to derive from a Semitic root ṢPR signifying be yellow or become yellow (see also safflower). This is an ancient name, as demonstrated by its Akkadian incarnation azupīru; yet it has no Hebrew cognate (see below on the Hebrew name). The Sumerian form azugna [𒌑𒄯𒊕] denotes a plant that has not clearly identified, possibly saffron.             Saffron corms © Laura Pazzaglia in Simmarano            Saffron field (Pampore near Srinagar, Kashmir)            Saffron corm, just unearthed   Directly or via medieaval Latin safranum, the word spread from the Iberic peninsular (then under Mauric rule) to practically all European languages and even some non-European ones, e. g. (to name a few geographical extremes) Portuguese açafrão, Italian zafferano, Greek zafora [ζαφορά], Georgian zaprana [ზაფრანა], Russian shafran [шафран] and Finnish sahrami. Similar names are also found in non-European languages, e. g., Amharic safron [ሰፍሮን], Kazakh zağıparan [зағыпаран], Hindi zafran [ज़ाफ़रान], Thai yafaran [หญ้าฝรั่น] and Japanese safuran [さふらん, サフラン].  The Sanskrit names of saffron point to the ancient Indian area of saffron production: Kashmirajanman [कश्मीरजन्मन्] product of Kashmir and kashmira [काश्मीर] the one from Kashmir; the second name, however, can also be used for other Kashmiri products, e. g., costus (putchuk), Saussurea lappa, Asteraceae. Such names are rare in today’s Indian languages, an example is Malayalam kashmiram [കാശ്മീരം].  Several super­ficially similar Indic names of saffron (Sanskrit kesaravara [केसरवर], Hindi kesar [केसर], Punjabi keshar [ਕੇਸ਼ਰ], Urdu kisar [کیسر]) are, however, not related but derive from Sanskrit kesara [केसर] hair, eye-brow, which refers to the thin, almost hairlike saffron threads. Yet note that the analogous Tibetan name gaser [སྒ་སེར] means turmeric.  The earliest Greek name of saffron is found in Linear B tablets: knakos [𐀏𐀙𐀒, also written logographically as 𐂔], which in the classical era became knekos [κνῆκος] or knikion [κνίκιον] and was used to denote other orange-flowering plants, e. g., safflower (see there for its affiliation). In India, Sanskrit kunkuma [कुंकुम] and Kashmiri kung [کونگ] probably belong to the same kin. That name even spread to Burma, where the plant is known by the (suspected) Indian loanword kunkum [ကုံကုမံ].  The knakos-type names fell into disuse after the collapse of the Mycenean civilization; from Homer’s time one, saffron was invariably called krokos [κρόκος] in Greek language.  In the Iliad, Homer used that word as a metaphor for the golden colour of dawn (see also poppy). The origin of that name is not known, but is is usually assumed pre-Greek and not Indo–European.  Except in Modern Greek, this name has not survived to any contemporary language, but cf. also Old English crog saffron. In its Latin form Crocus, the name appears as the botanical genus name of saffron.  The etymology of krokos is not known with certainty, but maybe there is a connection to Old Hebrew language.           Group of saffron plants   The Old Hebrew name for saffron is karkom [כרכם] and appears frequently in the Old Testament (see pome­granate). In Modern Hebrew, karkom was abandoned in favour of safran [זעפרן] which is directly derived from Arabic za'fran [زعفران].  The Arabic cognate of Hebrew karkom [כרכם] is kurkum [كركم], originally also with the meaning saffron. This is probably not a Semitic word, as is has close relatives in unrelated languages, e. g., Middle Persian kurkum and Sanskrit kunkuma [कुंकुम]. Arabic kurkum is no longer used for saffron, but denotes another yellow spice, turmeric.

    "origin": "Saffron is the triploid form of a species found in Eastern Greece, Crocus cartwrightianus; it probably appeared first in Crete. An origin in Western or Central Asia, although often suspected, has been disproved by botanical research. (Plant. Syst. Evol., 128, 89, 1977)  Because of being triploid, saffron is necessarily sterile, and its beautiful flowers cannot produce any seeds; propagation is possible only via corms. Distribution over larger distance requires human help, and so it’s surprising that saffron was known to the Sumerians almost 5000 years ago. It is not known, however, how the spice was transported from the Medi­terranean to Sumer in Meso­potamia.  Today, saffron is cultivated from the Western Mediterranean (Spain) to India (Kashmir). Spain and Iran are the largest producers, accounting together for more than 80% of the world’s production, which is approximately 300 tons per year.  In Europe, saffron production is almost limited to the Mediterranean; Spanish (La Mancha) saffron is generally considered the best. In much smaller scale, saffron is also cultivated in Italy and Greece (Crete).             Dried saffron in bulk quantity            Saffron flowers in Kashmir            Flowers on a saffron field (India)   Saffron does, however, quite well in cooler climates, and since the 15.th century, numerous attempts have been made to introduce saffron production to German, Switzerland, Austria and even England. For example, the town of Saffron Walden (Essex/England) got its name from local saffron production in the 16.th century. However, by the end of the 18.th century, most of the former saffron cultivation sites had become abandoned, and in our days, the only remaining saffron industry in Europe north of the Mediterranean is found in Mund, a small Swiss village in canton Wallis. In Mund, a few kilograms of saffron per year are produced in traditional way, at an elevation of about 1200 m.   Of the Western and Central Asian cultivation areas, Iran is most productive. In recent years, yield has been enormously increased and Iran now produces more saffron than Spain. Smaller amounts are harvested in Turkey and India.  Of all the Indian provenances, Kashmiri saffron has a particularly high reputation, but is hardly available outside India; furthermore, yields and quality have decreased because of the unfortunate political situation persisting since decades. Production is confined to a small area around the village Pampore [پانپورہ], just a few kilometers from the summer state capital Srinagar. The fields are divided into sections one or two square meters large and are kept free from vegetation all year round. Flowers show up for a about two weeks in the end of October or the beginning of November. They are picked from the plants (to stimulate more flower formation) and separated into styles are waste afterwards. Including the final drying of the styles, all the work is done by families that use little or no modern technology. Etymology  The name saffron comes from Arabic, where the spice is known as az-za'fran [الزعفران]; that name is often explained to derive from a Semitic root ṢPR signifying be yellow or become yellow (see also safflower). This is an ancient name, as demonstrated by its Akkadian incarnation azupīru; yet it has no Hebrew cognate (see below on the Hebrew name). The Sumerian form azugna [𒌑𒄯𒊕] denotes a plant that has not clearly identified, possibly saffron.             Saffron corms © Laura Pazzaglia in Simmarano            Saffron field (Pampore near Srinagar, Kashmir)            Saffron corm, just unearthed   Directly or via medieaval Latin safranum, the word spread from the Iberic peninsular (then under Mauric rule) to practically all European languages and even some non-European ones, e. g. (to name a few geographical extremes) Portuguese açafrão, Italian zafferano, Greek zafora [ζαφορά], Georgian zaprana [ზაფრანა], Russian shafran [шафран] and Finnish sahrami. Similar names are also found in non-European languages, e. g., Amharic safron [ሰፍሮን], Kazakh zağıparan [зағыпаран], Hindi zafran [ज़ाफ़रान], Thai yafaran [หญ้าฝรั่น] and Japanese safuran [さふらん, サフラン].  The Sanskrit names of saffron point to the ancient Indian area of saffron production: Kashmirajanman [कश्मीरजन्मन्] product of Kashmir and kashmira [काश्मीर] the one from Kashmir; the second name, however, can also be used for other Kashmiri products, e. g., costus (putchuk), Saussurea lappa, Asteraceae. Such names are rare in today’s Indian languages, an example is Malayalam kashmiram [കാശ്മീരം].  Several super­ficially similar Indic names of saffron (Sanskrit kesaravara [केसरवर], Hindi kesar [केसर], Punjabi keshar [ਕੇਸ਼ਰ], Urdu kisar [کیسر]) are, however, not related but derive from Sanskrit kesara [केसर] hair, eye-brow, which refers to the thin, almost hairlike saffron threads. Yet note that the analogous Tibetan name gaser [སྒ་སེར] means turmeric.  The earliest Greek name of saffron is found in Linear B tablets: knakos [𐀏𐀙𐀒, also written logographically as 𐂔], which in the classical era became knekos [κνῆκος] or knikion [κνίκιον] and was used to denote other orange-flowering plants, e. g., safflower (see there for its affiliation). In India, Sanskrit kunkuma [कुंकुम] and Kashmiri kung [کونگ] probably belong to the same kin. That name even spread to Burma, where the plant is known by the (suspected) Indian loanword kunkum [ကုံကုမံ].  The knakos-type names fell into disuse after the collapse of the Mycenean civilization; from Homer’s time one, saffron was invariably called krokos [κρόκος] in Greek language.  In the Iliad, Homer used that word as a metaphor for the golden colour of dawn (see also poppy). The origin of that name is not known, but is is usually assumed pre-Greek and not Indo–European.  Except in Modern Greek, this name has not survived to any contemporary language, but cf. also Old English crog saffron. In its Latin form Crocus, the name appears as the botanical genus name of saffron.  The etymology of krokos is not known with certainty, but maybe there is a connection to Old Hebrew language.           Group of saffron plants   The Old Hebrew name for saffron is karkom [כרכם] and appears frequently in the Old Testament (see pome­granate). In Modern Hebrew, karkom was abandoned in favour of safran [זעפרן] which is directly derived from Arabic za'fran [زعفران].  The Arabic cognate of Hebrew karkom [כרכם] is kurkum [كركم], originally also with the meaning saffron. This is probably not a Semitic word, as is has close relatives in unrelated languages, e. g., Middle Persian kurkum and Sanskrit kunkuma [कुंकुम]. Arabic kurkum is no longer used for saffron, but denotes another yellow spice, turmeric. Many languages, particularly European ones, have names for turmeric that relate to the Arabic, e. g., curcuma (English is a rare exception here). Of the whole kin of karkom and kurkum, only Armenian kerkoom [քըրքում] is still alive with the meaning saffron.

There are many trace constituents like tocopherols (0.1%) and phytosterols (total 0.1 to 0.5%); of the latter group, many are specific for the family of even the species.  The dark green colour of pumpkin seed oil is caused by carotenoids (15 ppm, mostly lutein) and even more by porphyrines (13 ppm, mostly chlorophyll b and pheophytin a). Pumpkin seed oil stains have terminated the career of many garments, particularly shirts and ties; the stains, however, pale quickly (though not always completely) in direct sunlight. See also annatto about vegetable colourings.           Pumpkin field in Styria   The flavour of pumpkin seeds and pumpkin seed oil develops in a toasting procedure, which is applied to the seeds immediately before extracting the oil. In this process, a multitude of volatile, flavourful compounds forms via the Maillard reaction. There is little scientific research in that field, but it seems that the most important flavour contributions come from pyrazines, e. g., 2,6-dimethylpyrazine. ",
    "origin": "Pumpkin, Cucurbita pepo, is native to Central America, especially México, where it has been cultivated for millennia.  After the Spaniards had discovered America, pumpkin was imported into Europe and Asia, where it was welcomed as a cheap and nutritional vegetable. Pumpkin seed oil is won from a particular mutant (Styrian oilseed pumpkin, Cucurbita pepo var. styriaca) with tender, non-woody, seed hulls, which is cultivated only in South-Eastern Austria and the adjacent areas of the neighbouring countries.  Pumpkin seed oil is produced in greater scale  only since the begin of the 20.th century. ",

In toasted cumin fruits, a large number of pyrazines has been identified as flavour compounds. Besides pyrazine and various alkyl derivatives (particularly, 2,5- and 2,6-dimethyl pyrazine), 2-alkoxy-3-alkylpyrazines seem to be the key compounds (2-ethoxy-3-isopropyl pyrazine, 2-methoxy-3-sec-butyl pyrazine, 2-methoxy-3-methyl pyrazine). Also a sulfur compound, 2-methylthio-3-isopropyl pyrazine, was found. All these Maillard-products are also formed when fenugreek or coriander are toasted. (Nahrung, 24, 645, 1980) ",
    "origin": "Western Asia, where it is culti­vated since Biblical times (see pome­granate). Main pro­duction countries today are India, Iran, Indonesia, China and the South Medi­terranean. ",
    "etymology": "English cumin comes from Latin cuminum, which was borrowed from Greek kyminon [κύμινον] (Mycenaean Greek kuminon [𐀓𐀖𐀜]). The word's further origin may be Semitic: Aramaic  kamuna [ܟܡܘܢܐ], Old Hebrew kammon [כמן], Egyptian kamnini, Akkadian kamûnu. Modern Semitic tongues often show similar forms: Arabic al-kamoun [الكمون], Hebrew kamon [כמון] and Amharic kemun [ከሙን]. The ultimate origin is maybe Sumerian gamun [𒂵𒁵, 𒁷𒌁, 𒌁], transmitted via Akkadian kamûnu. See also onion for Ancient Babylonian cooking.           Cumin inflorescences are compound umbels; the sub-umbels are borne by rays of different length. (perhaps)   Other names that belong to the same kin are common in many (predominantly European) languages, e. g., Portuguese cominho, Lithuanian kuminai, Basque komino, Greek kimino [κύμινο], Armenian kimon [քիմոն] and also Chinese ku-ming [枯茗]. Note, however, that many languages have very similar names signifying not cumin but caraway. This  may lead to considerable confusion. For example, in Russian, cumin is kmin [кмин] and caraway is tmin [тмин]; but in Ukrainian, kmyn [кмин] means caraway; moreover, in the related Bulgarian language, cumin is kimion [кимион] and caraway is kim [ким]!  Confusion between cumin and caraway has a particularly long record in German-speaking countries, where caraway is known as Kümmel.  The German name of cumin is derived from that of caraway, indicating that German cooks see cumin as an exotic variety of their well-known caraway: Kreuzkümmel cross-caraway, yet what motivates the cross element I cannot say.           Withering cumin plant  Photo: Ben-Erik van Wyk (Food Plants of the World, Briza Publications)   In most coun­tries of Northern and Eastern Europe, cumin is of little importance as a traditional flavouring, and con­sequently, is seen as an alien spice comparable to but distinct from the native spice caraway (foreign caraway). Often, the languages make poor distinction between the both, which may lead to troublesome confusion in cooking; more often, cumin is named as a foreign or oriental variety of caraway: Turkish caraway (Romanian chimion turcesc), Eastern caraway (Slovenian orientalske kumin) or even Egyptian caraway (Hungarian egyiptomi kömény). In countries where cumin is favoured over caraway, the same system often works in the opposite direction, and caraway is then named German cumin or similar.  In Italian cuisine, cumin has little use; yet cumin is named Roman caraway in many European languages (Russian rimskij tmin [римский тмин], Finnish roomankumina, Czech římský kmín). These names refer to the fact that cumin became known in Northern Europe, like many other plants of more Southern origin, only as a result of Charlemagne’s herb edicts (see lovage). So, cumin was viewed as a Mediterranean or Italian type of the native caraway.  In Sanskrit tongue, many late names of cumin appear related to a verbal root jri [जॄ] signifying cause decay, consume, e. g., jarana [जारण], jirana [जिरण], jirna [जीर्ण]. The root jri may also mean digest, which might be linked to the digestive properties of cumin.  Related words for cumin are today found in a vast area from the Caucasus to Central Asia to South East Asia: Georgian dzira [ძირა], Azeri cirə, Kazakh zere [зере], Farsi zireh [زیره], Urdu zirah [زیرہ], Hindi jira  [जीरा], Gujarati jiru [જીરુ], Punjabi jira [ਜੀਰਾ], Bengali jira [জিরা], Telugu jilakarra [జీలకర్ర], Tamil jiragam [சீரகம்], Dhivehi dhiri [ދިރި], Burmese ziya, Thai yeera [ยี่หร่า] and even Chinese ziran [孜然] (which entered the language as an adaptation of Uighur zire).  Sanskrit sugandha [सुगंध] cumin, also used for a variety of other aromatics (marjoram, lime, zedoary, civet, lotus), literally means well-smelling, indicates that cumin was highly popular in ancient India.  Another, more frequent Sanskrit name of cumin is ajaji [अजाजी].  In Chinese herbal medicine, cumin is commonly referred to as xiao hui xiang [小茴香] little fennel, which is rather the opposite of fennel being named as sweet cumin in several South and South East Asian tongues.  Note on pronunciation (for non-English speakers): cumin is more or less pronounced as come in, but stressed on the first syllable. "

    "etymology": "The genus name foeniculum (Latin for little hay) probably refers to  the aroma of fennel and is the source of the name of fennel in many con­temporary Euro­pean languages. Examples are German Fenchel, Italian finocchio, Portuguese funcho, Swedish fänkål, Dutch venkel, Finnish fenkoli and Russian fenkhel [фенхель]. There are, however, a couple of similar names referring to fenugreek in some European tongues that likewise derive from the same Latin word foenum hay.          Sterile bronze fennel plant   Some languages do not distinguish clearly between fennel and anise. For example, in Amharic, the name insilal [እንስላል] may stand for fennel, anise and even dill. In Hebrew tongue, the term shumar [שומר] fennel may also used for anise, although there is a separate name for the latter, anis [אניס]. Moreover, dill has a very similar name: shamir [שמיר] — to make things worse, ash-shamir [الشمر] is the name of fennel in Arabic!  Also in Romanian and Turkish languages, one finds identical or very similar terms for fennel and anise, which might fool a cook (or cookbook writer). Some European languages name fennel as a pharmaceutical variant of dill, e. g., Estonian apteegitill and Russian aptechnyi ukrop [аптечный укроп] pharmacy-dill. On the other hand, a Yiddish name of fennel is italienisher koper [איטאַליענישער קאָפּער] Italian dill.           Young fennel shoots           Sterile fennel plant, reddish–brown cultivar (Bronze fennel)   In the Hindi tongue, anise and fennel are often syn­onymously called saunf [सौंफ] although of the two spices, only fennel is common in Indian cuisine. To make a clear distinction between the both, fennel may also be called moti saunf [मोटी सौंफ] thick fennel, because its fruits are somewhat larger. Similar relations between the names of these two spices are also found in some other Indian languages, but the Urdu tongue closely related to Hindi has distinct names for fennel (saunf [سونف]) and anise (anisuan [انیسواں]).  Many other Indic names of fennel derive from a word for sweet, e. g., Oriya modhuri [ମଧୁରୀ], Bengali mouri [মৌরি] and Sanskrit madhurika [मधुरिका] See licorice and bear’s garlic for details on the Proto-Indo–European root MEDʰU sweet. In Sri Lanka, there is an apparently similar name maduru [මාදූරු], but I doubt whether it belongs to the same kin: There is an alternative Sinhala name maha-duru [මහදුරු] large cumin, of which maduru could be a contracted form.  A curious outsider among the Indian names is Kashmiri badyan [بادین], which almost everywhere else stands for star anise.  The Indonesian name jintan manis sweet cumin (also applied to anise) reflects the much greater importance of cumin, of which fennel is thought to be a variety, in Indonesian cuisine. Analogous formations are French aneth doux or Russian sladkij ukrop [сладкий укроп] sweet dill and Hungarian édeskömény sweet caraway. All these spices (anise, cumin, dill, caraway) belong to the same plant family (Apiaceae)  and, in varying degree, resemble each other in shape and fragrance. See also cicely.           Fennel umbels www.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de   The Modern Greek name for fennel, maratho [μάραθο], can be traced back to Ancient Greek marathon [μάραθον] (the oldest recorded form is mara­thuwon [𐀔𐀨𐀶𐀺] on the Linear B tablets); possibly, there is a connection to the Indic names mentioned in the previous paragraph.   Names derived thence are found in Coptic (malatron [ⲙⲁⲗⲁⲧⲣⲟⲛ]) and in a small cluster of South East European languages: Albanian maraja, Bulgarian morach [морач] and Romanian mărar; the latter, however, has changed its meaning to dill, again emphasizing the widespread confusion between those two plants.  Marathon [Μαραθών] (Modern Marathonas [Μαραθώνας]) is also the name of a famous site in Attica, where the Greeks defeated the Persians in 490, thus laying the foundation for the later glory of the classical era. The placename is said to refer to the abundance of wild fennel growing there. The island capital of Madeira, Funchal, certainly got its name from the abundant fennel plants (Portuguese funcho).  Another group of related names can be spotted in the tongues of Western Asia: Turkish rezene (hence Bulgarian rezene [резене] and Macedonian razijan [разијан]), Kurdish dhaziana [ذازیانة] and Farsi razianeh [رازیانه]. I do not know anything about the origin of these names. "

Conjugated Diaryl­heptanoids (1,7-diaryl-hepta-1,6-diene-3,5-diones, e. g. curcumin) are  responsible for the orange colour and probably also for the pungent taste (3 to 4%).

    "origin": "Because of an­cient culti­vation, the origin of tur­meric can­not be ac­curate­ly recon­structed; probably South East Asia or South Asia. Turmeric is a triploid plant and arose from hybridization between Wild turmeric (C. aromatica) with an unidentied relative. Turmeric rarely flowers and even if it does, it will never produce fruits; rather, as with with all triploid plants, it must propagate asexually.  A related species, C. xanthor­rhiza, grows on Jawa, where it is called temu lawak; in taste and culinary merits, it is equivalent to C.  longa. ",
    "etymology": "In many languages, the names of turmeric just mean yellow root: Dutch geel­wortel, German Gelb­wurz, Arabic uqdah safra [عقدة صفرا], Finnish kelta­juuri [keltainen yellow and juuri root] and Modern Greek kitrino­riza [κιτρινό­ριζα], where kitrinos [κίτρινος] means yellow, probably an allusion to lemon or similar citrus fruits. The same meaning is found in the species name of the Jawa­nese variety of turmeric, C. xanthor­rhiza: Ancient Greek xanthe rhiza [ξανθὴ ῥίζα] yellow root. Other names relate turmeric to related rhizomes, adding an epithet yellow, e. g., Chinese  huang jiang [黃薑] and Russian imbir zhyoltyj [имбирь жёлтый] yellow ginger (from zhyoltyj [жёлтый] yellow) and Czech žlutý zázvor yellow zedoary. Serbian has, among others, žutņak [жутњак] the yellow one, a noun formed from the adjective žuti [жути] yellow.  English turmeric derives from the (now obsolete) French terre-mérite (Latin terra merita, meritorious earth), probably because ground turmeric resembles mineral pigments (ochre).           Ornamental turmeric flowers (C. alismatifolia)           Flowering turmeric on a field in Nepal           Turmeric flower   The genus na­me Curcuma likens turmeric to saffron, the most relevant yellow plant dye in the An­cient World. Curcuma is Latini­zation of Arabic al-kurkum [الكركم], which ori­ginally meant saffron but is now used for turmeric only. Compare also the name of saffron in Bib­lical He­brew, karkom [כרכם]. In most con­tem­porary Euro­pean lan­guages, the names of tur­meric are derived more or less directly from Latin cur­cuma. Examples include Finnish, Serbo-Croatian, Russian and Dutch kur­kuma [кур­кума], French and Italian cur­cuma, Spanish cúr­cuma and Romanian cur­cumă. Scandi­navian names show stronger variation from the rest: Danish gurke­meje, Norwegian gurke­meie and Swedish gurk­meja.  The similarity to saffron is reflected by names like Indian saffron in several European tongues: German indischer Safran, Croatian indijski šafran, French safran des Indes or Turkish hint safranı. Compare also Spanish azafrán arabe Arabic saffron. On the other side, saffron is named nghe tay [nghệ  tây] Western turmeric in Vietnam, where turmeric is native and saffron just an exotic oddity.           Inflorescence of turmeric; an open flower is seen bottom right           Turmeric flower           Flowering turmeric on a field in Nepal   The toponym India has a long history. It is derived from Sanskrit sindhu [सिंधु] river, which was particularly used for the Indus River in North-Western India. There is the speculation that the Sanskrit term itself is a loan  from Dravidian languages and corresponds to the Dravidian root CĪNT date palm tree (Modern Tamil intu [ஈந்து]). Was the Indus River, then, originally the river where the palm trees grow?  The Greeks took their designation for the country from the Persian form of the same name, hindush, and named it Indike chora [Ἰνδικὴ χώρα] Indian land (properly land around the Indus river) and later simply India [Ἰνδία]; that name became common in the Hellenistc era and spread, via Latin India, to almost all Western European languages. Western and Central Asian names mostly come dirctly from the Persian, e. g., Kazakh ündi [үнді], Arabic al-hind [الهند] and of course Farsi hindustan [هندوستان] India; also Farsi hendi [هندی] and Turkish Hint Indian.          Inflorescence of turmeric; an open flower is seen bottom right   The suffix -stan, found in Hindustan and many modern country names, is also of Persian origin and related to Sanskrit sthana [स्थान] home, place of abiding.          Turmeric flower   Because of the strong association between India and spices in Europe, many spices contain an India-Element in their names. Examples are, besides Indian saffron for turmeric, designations like Indian nut (coconut, nutmeg), Indian date (tamarind), Indian anise (star anise), Indian parsley (coriander) and many more. In Indian cress (nasturtium), however, the epithet points not to India but to Latin America.           Turmeric plants           Flowering turmeric plants   In the greater part of India, the local names of turmeric relate to Sanskrit haridra [हरिद्रा]; yet the analysis is made more difficult as haridra has no Indo–Euro­pean origin, but is a loan from an unknown substrate language. Almost all modern Indo–Aryan tongues have names of this kin, e. g. Hindi, Urdu und Punjabi haldi [हल्दी, ہلدی, ਹਲਦੀ], Kashmiri ladar [لدر], Bengali holud [হলুদ], and Oriya haladi [ହଳଦୀ]. Among the few exceptions are Sinhala kaha [කහ] and Nepali besar [बेसार] (similar to Dogri bsar [बसार], both probably bor­rowed from the same Hima­layan source); yet  Sino–Tibetean Newari has a Sankrit-based form halu [हलु], which ob­vious­ly cannot be ex­plained as a bor­rowing from Nepali.  Among those Indian languages not belonging to the Indo–European family, names of the widely used turmeric are much more diverse. Deep in the South, we find a cluster (Tamil and Malayalam manjal [மஞ்சள், മഞ്ഞൾ], Tulu manjalu [ಮಂಜಲು]), but in the more Northern Dravidian languages, independent names show up: Kannada arisina [ಅರಿಷಿಣ] and Telugu pasupu [పసుపు]. The only example from the Munda family I was able to research is Santali sasang; it would be interesting to learn whether other Munda languages have names that could qualify as a source of Sanskrit haridra.           Turmeric plants growing in a Sri Lankan tourist spice garden   Among the Hima­layan lan­guages, Tibetan gaser [སྒ་སེར་] should be mentioned, as it looks con­spicious­ly similar to a pan-Indian name for saffron exempli­fied by Hindi kesar [केसर]; however, the ortho­graphy of the Tibetan word does not point to a recent loan. Native lan­guages of North Eastern India, usually be­longing to the Kuki–Chin branch of the Sino–Tibetan lan­guage family, have local names for tur­meric that seem related, e. g., Mani­puri yai-ngang [য়াইঙং, ꯌꯥꯢꯉꯪ], Rongmei Naga injaikaraim, Mizo and Hmar ai-eng; the unrelated Khasi has shynrai. A few of the North Eastern languages have borrowed the name from Indic tongues, perhaps Hindi or Bengali: Garo holdi and Bodo holde [हालदै]).          Turmeric plants growing in a Sri Lankan tourist spice garden   Some East African names of turmeric, Amharic ird [ኢርድ] and Tigrinya herud [ህሩድ], present a very special case: They show an almost uncanny resemblance to the Indian forms, which fits nicely to the observations that Ethiopia and Eritrea are the only countries outside of Asia that employ turmeric in their foods, and that these countries have a long tradition of seafare, as they lie conveniently on the sea route between India and Europe. Moreover, Ethiopian spice blends have many points in common with Indian ones (see long pepper for a more thourough discussion).

    "etymology": "Englisch tamarind is based on the Arabic name of that plant, tamr al-hindi [تمر الهندي]. Similar or identical names are found all over Europe, e. g., Swedish, Estonian and Russian tamar­ind [тамаринд], Spanish and Italian tamar­indo and Greek tamarin [τάμαριν]. Turkish demir­hindi shows a slight variation of sounds.          Tamarind flower   Arabic at‑tamr al-hindi [التمر الهندي] simply means the date of India (date being a general name for the fruits of various palm trees); need­less to say, tamar­ind neither stems from India nor is it related to palm trees. In spite of this defi­ciency, loan trans­lations of this name have made their way into some languages like English (Indian date), German (Indi­sche Dattel), Hungarian (Indiai datolya) and Russian (Indiyski finik [Индийский финик]), although they are not much used in modern speech. German also has obsolete Sauer­dattel sour date.  The term date itself came to English via Old Provençal datil and allegedly goes back to Greek daktylos [δάκτυλος] finger; this naming, obviously motivated by shape resemblance, seems even more fit for tamarind than for true dates.

It supposedly forms by oxidative deamination of 4-hydroxy isoleucine.  Sotolone has a spicy flavour and was also found a key flavour in fermented protein seasonings, e. g., Maggi sauce. There is chemical similarity between sotolone and the phthalides responsible for the quite similar flavour of lovage leaves.  (ACS Symposium Series, 660, 1997)  Toasted fenugreek seeds owe their altered, more nutty flavour to another type of hetero­cyclic compounds, the so-called pyrazines.

(Journal of Essential Oil Research, 16, 356, 2004)  Among the non-volatile components of fenugreek seeds, the furostanol glycosides are probably responsible for the bitter taste; among the several more compounds yet identified, steroles and diosgenin derivatives (of potential interest for the pharmaceutical industry) and trigonellin (N-methyl-pyridinium-3-carboxylate, 0.4%) are most worth noting.

Cf. also the Yiddish term for the genus,  draykantl [דרײַקאַנטל] three-edged.  The Latin species name foenum graecum means Greek hay, referring to both  the intensive hay fragrance of dried fenugreek herb and its Eastern Mediterranean origin. That Latin name still lives in many European tongues, e. g., English fenugreek or Dutch fenegriek. Note that in some of these languages, the name for fennel may look similar, because fennel also derives from Latin foenum hay.  Other languages use adaptions of foenum graecum, like Slovak grško seno Greek hay and Estonian kreeka lambalääts Greek clover. The Classical Greek Greek name of fenugreek, telis [τῆλις], is also found in Coptic tili [ⲧⲓⲗⲓ], but has vanished without a trace from modern languages (maybe with the exception of Bulgarian tilchets [тилчец]?).  Several Germanic languages have closely related names, e. g., German Bockshorn­klee, Swedish bockhorns­klöver and Norwegian  bukkehorn­kløver buck’s horn’s clover. These names refer to the long, pointed fruits (legumes) which may be com­pared with a buck’s horn. Similar names meaning buck’s horn are also given to the large pods of St. John’s Bread (Carob) regionally. There seems to be an analogous name in Old Greek, boukeras [βουκέρας] cow-horn, but this is not the regular name for this plant.           Fenugreek plant with immature fruits   Spanish al­holva and Portu­guese al­forba are, like many other plant names used on the Iberic pen­insula (see also capers), bor­rowed from Arabic: al-hulbah [الحلبه] the fenu­greek. The Arabic name hulbah [حلبه] is probably a native Semitic name deriving from the same root ḤLB milk that also lies behind the name of mahaleb cherry. In that case, that name would have been motivated by the strong galact­agogue action of fenugreek which is widely used in folk medicine. The Hebrew cognate is hilbeh [חילבה], which appears in Yiddish as khilbe [כילבע].           Fenugreek flower www.biozak.de           In Nepal, I found this fenugreek strain with a bright purple leaf edge   Arabic hulbah is also the source for several names of fenu­greek in more Eastern lan­guages: Malayalam uluva [ഉലുവ], Sinhala uluhal [උලුහාල්], Malay halba, Indonesian klabat, Chinese hu lu ba [葫蘆巴, 胡芦巴], Viet­namese ho lo ba [hồ lô ba] and Korean horopa [호로파].  Middle Persian sambalidag is the predecessor of modern Farsi shanbalileh [شنبلیله] or Urdu shanbalid [شنبلید]. It has been borrowed to Russian as shambala [шамбала], and there is also a related form in Aramaic, shebbelila [ܫܒܠܝܠܗ]. A still earlier form can be found in another Semitic language (Akkadian šambaliltu), but the word structure is certainly not Semitic and it must have been an early loan from an unknown source.  Rather similar names are found in some Baltic countries (Finnish sarviapila, Latvian sierāboliņš), but they are unrelated to the Russian and Persian names; rather, the Finnish term appears calqued on (North) Germanic forms (sarvi horn and apila clover). While I could not identify the first element in the Latvian name, the second āboliņš also means clover, and thus the two plant names are either related or just parallel constructions. As an aside, Finnish sarvi comes from a Proto-Finno-Ugric root ŚORWA which is, however, an early loan from Proto-Indo-Iranian ŚR̥VA (from Proto-Indo–European ḰER, ḰR̥̄SEN head, horn); that root is sometimes errorneously believed to lie behind the name of ginger.  There is also a puzzling close but likely coincidential match between Sumerian sullim [𒌑𒂙𒊬] and Georgian solinji [სოლინჯი], with no similar forms in adjacent languages.

The Hebrew cognate is hilbeh [חילבה], which appears in Yiddish as khilbe [כילבע].           Fenugreek flower www.biozak.de           In Nepal, I found this fenugreek strain with a bright purple leaf edge   Arabic hulbah is also the source for several names of fenu­greek in more Eastern lan­guages: Malayalam uluva [ഉലുവ], Sinhala uluhal [උලුහාල්], Malay halba, Indonesian klabat, Chinese hu lu ba [葫蘆巴, 胡芦巴], Viet­namese ho lo ba [hồ lô ba] and Korean horopa [호로파].  Middle Persian sambalidag is the predecessor of modern Farsi shanbalileh [شنبلیله] or Urdu shanbalid [شنبلید]. It has been borrowed to Russian as shambala [шамбала], and there is also a related form in Aramaic, shebbelila [ܫܒܠܝܠܗ]. A still earlier form can be found in another Semitic language (Akkadian šambaliltu), but the word structure is certainly not Semitic and it must have been an early loan from an unknown source.  Rather similar names are found in some Baltic countries (Finnish sarviapila, Latvian sierāboliņš), but they are unrelated to the Russian and Persian names; rather, the Finnish term appears calqued on (North) Germanic forms (sarvi horn and apila clover). While I could not identify the first element in the Latvian name, the second āboliņš also means clover, and thus the two plant names are either related or just parallel constructions. As an aside, Finnish sarvi comes from a Proto-Finno-Ugric root ŚORWA which is, however, an early loan from Proto-Indo-Iranian ŚR̥VA (from Proto-Indo–European ḰER, ḰR̥̄SEN head, horn); that root is sometimes errorneously believed to lie behind the name of ginger.  There is also a puzzling close but likely coincidential match between Sumerian sullim [𒌑𒂙𒊬] and Georgian solinji [სოლინჯი], with no similar forms in adjacent languages. "

I feel it is def­initely lemony, with a certain tickling quality (see also lemon myrtle about citrus-scented herbs and spices). Some people like to describe it as sweet cumin or the air after a violent thunderstorm in summer or a sharp citrus odour; I have also read soapy, although I cannot agree. ",
    "main-constituents": "The leaves contain about 0.1% essential oil, whose main component is limonene. Among the other compounds identified in the oil are perillaldehyde and an unusual monoterpenoid ketone, cis-4-caranone. ",
    "origin": "Several species of Limnophila are found in silent waters Southeast Asia; some of them are common aquarium plants in the West. In Vietnam, rice paddy herb is mostly cultivated in flooded rice fields.  A related species, Limnophila rugosa (Roth) Merril (syn. L. roxburghii, Herpestris rugosa Roth) has anise-scented leaves; it is used for culinary purposes only occasionally (Jawa).           Growing rice paddy herb           Rice paddy herb with flower   Because of its dependence on high tempera­tures and high air humidity, rice paddy herb culti­vation is a true chal­lenge out­side the tropics.  I know of other­wise skilled gardeners who lost their plants regularly, but recently I have found a way that will (I hope) give me a constant supply of this great herb in the future. That’s how it goes: Get some fresh stems from another plant or your local Thai or Vietnamese grocer. If placed in water, they will de­velop roots within one or two weeks; in the mean­time, they must be cover­ed with a plastic bag or the like to give them enough air humid­ity. In this phase, direct sun­light will kill the plants, so put them in a shadowy but not dark place.  When enough roots have been formed, plant the stems into a high, trans­parent con­tainer filled with soil to cover most of the roots. A mixture of ordinary soil plus small, porous grains of burned clay is perfect. Keep the plants warm and humid. After a few days, they will tolerate (and even appreciate) intensive sunlight. ",
    "etymology": "The genus name Limno­phila is formed from Greek limne [λίμνη] pond and philos [φιλός] friend and refers to the plant’s natural habitat. Some Chinese names also hint at the aquatic environ­ment: Mandarin shui fu rong [水芙蓉] water-hibiscus and Cantonese seui fa [水花] water flower. While other members of the genus grow only submersed, L. aromatica thrives above the water surface.          Rice paddy herb with flower   English rice paddy herb also hints at the growth of that plant in flooded rice fields. The English term paddy specifically means wet rice field, not just any area where rice is grown (derived from Malay padi uncooked rice). Cf. also Chinese tian xiang cao [田香草] fragrant field plant (the glyph for tian obviously shows fields from a bird’s perspective).  For reasons which I am unable to explain, there are extremely close ties between the names of rice paddy herb and perilla in several East Asian languages, even to the point of identical naming: Chinese zi su [紫蘇], Korean soyop [소엽] and Japanese shiso [シソク] usually stand for perilla, although they can mean rice paddy herb on occasion (especially in Korean). Yet, if any of these names is expanded by an element meaning grass, herb, it comes to mean rice paddy herb predominantly (zi su cao [紫蘇草], soyop-pul [소엽풀], shiso-kusa [シソクサ]). "

The scent of pandanus leaves de­vel­ops only on wilting; the fresh, intact plants hardly have any odour. On the other hand, dried pandanus leaves lose their fragrance quite quickly. ",
    "main-constituents": "The flavour component of pandanus leaves is not well known. It is speculated that the flavour is due to a volatile product of oxidative degradation of a yellow carotenoid pigment that forms only when the plant withers. In that respect, there are similarities to saffron and rose, which also contain carotenoid-derived aroma compounds.  The best candidate is 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, which was found in pandanus leaves at levels of about 1 ppm (Cereal Chemistry, 70, 381, 1993) and which also occurs in aromatic rice cultivars; another possibility is ethyl formiate, which is also common to both rice and pandanus leaves (Naturwissenschaften, 71, 215, 1984).          Stilt-root of a Sri Lankan Pandanus plant   Yet another study found 3-methyl-2-(5H)-furanone as main volatile compound in pandanus leaves, besides 3-hexanol, 4-methylpentanol, 3-hexanone and 2-hexanone (Flavor and Chemistry of Ethnic Foods, [Proceedings of a Meeting held during the 5th Chemical Congress of North America], Cancun, Nov.  11-15, 1997  (1999)).  The leaves also contain piperidine-type alkaloids (pandamarine, pandameri­lactones) with pyrroline-derived structures  (Phytochemistry, 34, 1159, 1993)  On distillation, the leaves do yield traces of an essential oil, but it is unclear to which extent the volatile oil contributes to pandanus’ flavour. In Sri Lankan pandanus leaves (Pandanus latifolius, allegedly synonym to P. amaryllifolius), the following aroma components have been identified in concentrations less than one microgramm per kilogramm (ppb) fresh material: styrene 0.62, ?formylthiphene 0.76, linalool 0.29, β-caryophyllene 0.55, β-farnesene 0.18, 1,2-dimethoxybenzene 0.15 and β-selinene 1.24 ppb.

Today, it is distributed over Southern India, Sri Lanka, pen­insular South East Asia, Indo­nesia and Western New Guinea.  Male flowers are extremely rare, and there is no scientific description of a female flower for this species.  The only known instances of flowering plants occurred on the Moluccas archipelago, and it is plausible that the species evolved there. The species is, however, unlikely to have evolved from hybridisation, as is shares its chromosome number (2n=60) with most other representatives of the genus.  It is also interesting to note that P. amarylli­folius is the only Pandanus species with fragrant leaves. Taken together, these signs, together with the lack of a wild population and the large distribution, imply a long tradition of cultivation.  Another strange oddity in  P.  amarylli­folius should be mentioned: The plant has two distinct growth forms. Undisturbed, it developes into a small tree with usually unbranched, palm-like stem and large leaves (up to 2 m); if leaves are continuously harvested, it will instead acquire a low, more shrubby form with smaller leaves (up to 75 cm) and without  a visible trunk. This small growth form is favoured by ever-wet tropical climate, but can slowly revert into the lage growth form if left undisturbed. The two growth forms are distinct enough that they have been misinterpreted as two different species in the past. Etymology The genus name derives from the Indonesian name of the tree, pandan.  The Marathi name ambemohor patta [आंबेमोहोर पत्ता] ambemohor leaf alludes to the olfactoric similarity between pandanus leaves and the aromatic long grain rice type ambemohor (mango flower), which is grown in Nashik district near Mumbai (Bombay).

    "main-constituents": "Poppy seeds contain 40 to 50% of fixed oil, which is obtained by cold pressing in yields of only 12 to 18%. It is rich in unsaturated fatty acids (iodine index is 133 to 144): 60% linoleic acid, 30% oleic acid, 3% linolenic acid (triply unsaturated; essential for human nutrition) and less than 10% saturated fats. Among the volatile components of poppy seeds, aliphatic hydrocarbons and aldehydes have been reported. 2-Pentylfurane is a key aroma compound.           Poppy pod           Poppy flower www.botanikus.de   Opium is the dried latex from unripe seed capsules; each capsule yields about 20 to 50 mg. Besides wax, resin, proteins and sugars, it contains approxi­mately 20% of alkaloids, of which morphine (morphin, typically, 12%) is the most important. Opium for smoking (chandu [चण्डू]) is roasted over fire and fermented, which reduces the alkaloid content to about one quarter and leads to the development of a typical flavour. Raw opium is in our days rarely used medically; normally, it is either standardized (to exactly 10% morphine), or the different alkaloids are separated and applied in pure form to the patients. Opium contains two families of alkaloids: Phenanthrene-type alkaloids include morphine (7 to 23%), codeine (max. 3%), thebaine (max. 3%, typically much lower) and the synthetic heroin. Benzylisochinoline-type alkaloids are more common in the plant kingdom; in opium, they are represented by narcotine (=noscapine, up to 12%), papaverine (max. 1.5%) and narceine (0.2%). Most of these have their special field of application in modern medicine.  Official opium production is 2000 tons per year, mostly by India and Turkey.           Poppy flower and unripe pods   The alkaloid content of poppy seeds is low (50 ppm) and cannot have any pharma­ceutical effect. It is, however, high enough that morphine can be detected in the urine after heavy poppy seed consume,  which might make for an unpleasant surprise in drug tests. ",
    "origin": "Poppy is generally believed to stem from West Asia, although more recently a West Mediterranean origin was suggested. In any case, poppy was cultivated in Europe since the Neolithic era; it is probably one of the earliest plants cultivated by men in that region. ",
    "etymology": "The genus name Papaver is Classical Latin for the poppy plant. It appears to have no Indo–European cognates and cannot be explained further. The Latin word lives today in several Romance languages, e. g. French pavot and Portu­guese papoila. It is also the source of English poppy (Old English popæg); Amharic papi [ፓፒ] belongs to the same kin, probably being a recent loan. In Hungarian, pipacs means the related wild plant corn poppy (Flander’s poppy, Papaver rhoes).           Corn poppy is a wild plant in Europe           Golden poppy is a popular ornamental   The species name somniferum (Latin somnus sleep and  ferre bring) refers to the narcotic properties of opium, as does Spanish adormidera (from Latin dormire to sleep). Cf. also an Arabic name of poppy, abu an-num [ابو النوم] father of sleep.  The German name of poppy, Mohn, closely related to Yiddish mon [מאָן] and Dutch maan, has a large number of cognates in other Indo–European tongues: In Northern Germanic tongues, we find Norwegian and Danish valmue and Swedish vallmo, which all go back to Old Norse valmugi. In modern Slavonic tongues, the name is almost universally mak [мак], deriving from Old Slavonic maku; cf. also Romanian  mac and Latvian magone. Further members of that kin are Old Greek mekon [μήκων] and Armenian  megon [մեկոն]. Despite its wide distribution, there is no etymology known for these names; they probably all stem from an ancient tongue of the Mediterranean now lost.          Golden poppy is a popular ornamental   Modern Greek names the genus of poppy-like plants as papa­rouna [παπα­ρούνα], derived from Latin papaver. But the ancient native term  mekon lives on in the names of the single species, for example mikon i ipnoforos [μήκων η υπνοφόρος] sleep-bringing poppy for P. somniferum.  From West Asia to South-East Asia, related names for poppy are found in a huge area: Turkish haşhaş, Georgian khoshkhoshi [ხოშხოში], Kurdish khash-khash [خةشخاش], Farsi and Urdu khash-khash [خشخاش], Hindi und Gujarati khas-khas [खसखस, ખસખસ], Telugu gasagasaalu [గసగసాలు], Tamil casa casa [கசகசா], Dhivehi kaskasaa [ކަސްކަސާ] and finally Malay kas kas. I do not know where these names originate from, yet I notice similar Sanskrit names: Khaskhasa [खस्खस] and shasa [षस].           An ornamental poppy flower (probably P. bracteatum)   Some Indian languages form their word for poppy from another root: Bengali posto [পোস্তো], Hindi, Punjabi and Urdu post [पोस्त, ਪੋਸਤ, پوست], Telugu postukaya [పోస్తుకాయ] and Tamil postakkai [போஸ்தக்காய்]. In the early colonial era, that name  appears in English as post or posto, where it denoted not only the poppy plant, but also a narcotic beverage prepared from poppy heads which was, in the 17.th century, highly popular at the Moghul courts of Northern India, because alcohol was forbidden due to religious restrictions.  The term opium for the concentrated latex obtained from unripe capsules is used since Greco-Roman times; it is related to Greek opos [ὄπος] sap, juice of plants. The word was transferred to Arabic (ubim [أوبيم]) and Farsi (afyun [افیون]); Sanskrit ahiphena [अहिफेन]  poppy, opium belongs to the same kin, but was secondarily associated with ahi [अहि] snake and phena [फेन] saliva, foam, froth, in reference to the adverse effects of continued opium intake. Related terms are Marathi aphu or aphin [अफू, अफीण] and Telugu abhini [అభిని] opium. Cf. also Korean apyon [아편] and Chinese yapian [鸦片] opium.  The Japanese kanji signs 芥子 may refer to two different plants: In the meaning poppy, they are pronounced keshi [けし], yet if spoken karashi [からし] they mean black oder white mustard.

    "main-constitu­ents": "Rue contains max. 1% of an es­sential oil, whose main com­po­nents are 2-hen­decanone (2-un­decanone, methyl­nonyl­ketone, up to 60%) and 2-nonanone (methyl­heptyl­ketone) plus several more ketones and cor­responding secon­dary alcohols. Methyl anthranilate and anethole glycol are also reported; terpenoids are re­presented mainly by limonene, α-pinene, cumin­aldehyde  and l,8-cineol.  Responsible for the bitter taste is rutin (7 to 8% in the dried leaves), a poly­phenolic flavono­lone glycoside con­taining the di­saccharid rutinose as sugar component. Rutin is also found in capers, water pepper and orange peel.           Close-up to rue flowers           Rue flowers  ",
    "origin": "The origin of rue probably lies in the Medi­terra­nean or Western Asia. ",
    "etymology": "Most Western European languages have similar names for rue: English and French rue, Dutch ruit and German Raute all go back to Latin ruta, which itself was borrowed from Greek rhyte [ῥυτή]. The ultimate origin of the word is not known.  Quite interestingly, several names of rue have chance homo­nyms: English rue may also mean remorse, French rue almost always means street and German Raute is the mathematical term for rhomb, equilateral parallelogram. Moreover, the German noun Rute whip is also unrelated.           Flowering rue www.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de           Flowering rue   In the New Testa­ment (see pome­granate about biblical herbs and spices), rue is men­tioned as peganon [πήγανον], a name still used in Modern Greek as apiganos [απήγανος]. There have been attempts to link that name with Greek pegos [πηγός] strong and thus to a Proto-Indo–Euro­pean root PEH₂Ḱ strengthen (cf. fix), but the semantic connection is unclear at best. Related plant names are French péganium, Hebrew pegam [פיגם], Aramaic pegana [ܦܓܢܐ], and Arabic al-fayjan [الفيجن], perhaps also Georgian t’igani [ტეგანი].  In modern botanical taxonomy, the term Peganum denotes a genus from a remotely related family Zygophyllaceae, order Sapindales. The best known member is Syrian Rue, Peganum harmala, a hallucinogenic plant that is occasionally confused with rue or in particular Aleppo Rue (see also southern­wood for another plant sometimes confused with rue).  Names of rue in many tongues from Western Asia (Turkish sedefotu, Kurdish sudab [سوداب]) through Central Asia (Farsi sadab [سداب]) to Southern India (Telugu sadapa [సదాప]) derive from Middle Persian sudab. Folk etymology has linked the Turkish name to sedef mother of pearl, alluding to the bluish hue of the leaves of that plant.  Bulgarian sedefche [седефче] is a borrowing from Turkish.  The Latin species name, which rue shares with several other aromatic plants like celery or dill, means strongly smelling: Latin gravis heavy and olens participle present of olere smell.

    "sensory-quality": "The dried seeds taste nutty; their flavour is dramatically increased by toasting. Oriental (dark) sesame oil has a strong, somewhat dominant nutty odour. ",
    "main-con­stituents": "The seeds contain about 50 to 60% of a fixed oil, which is charac­terized by a two lignanes, sesamin and sesamolin (approximately 300 ppm in the oil), whence during refinement two phenolic antioxidants, sesamol (3,4‑methylene­dioxy­phenol) and sesaminol, are formed.          Unripe sesame capsules   Sesame oil is mostly composed of tri­glycerides of the singly un­saturated oleic acid (40%) and the doubly un­saturated linoleic acid (45%), besides approxi­mately 10% saturated fats (iodine index 110). Because of its powerful antioxidant and because triply unsaturated fatty acids are missing, sesame oil has an excellent shelf life.  Oriental sesame oil owes its characteristic flavour to a huge number of compounds which form only during the toasting procedure. Most prominent are 2‑furyl­methanthiol, which also plays an important part in the flavour of coffee and roasted meat, guajacol (2‑methoxy­phenol), phenyl­ethanthiol and furaneol (4‑hydroxy-2,5‑dimethyl-3(2H)‑furanone); furthermore, vinyl­guacol, 2,4‑deca­dienal, 2‑pentyl­pyridine and other O- or N-containing hetero­cycles are reported (2‑acetyl pyrroline, 2‑pentyl pyridine, alkylated and acylated pyrazines). The hetero­cyclic compound 2‑acetyl pyrroline is thought to be the impact aroma compound of South-East Asian pandanus leaves.  Yet other sources claim that pyrazines are the key aroma compounds of toasted sesame seeds. It was found out that pyrazines dominate the flavour for mild toasting conditions (160 °C), while toasting at higher temperature (200 °C) leads to increased formation of furanes.

    "origin": "Sesame is an ancient  cultigen. Today, it is mostly grown in India and the Far East (China, Korea), but its origin is probably tropic Africa (although some other sources seem to favour an Indian origin). ",
    "etymology": "The name sesame and most of its pendants in present-day European languages goes back to Greek sesamon [σήσαμον] (Mycenaean Greek sasaman [𐀭𐀭𐀔, also logographically 𐀭]) which is itself a non-Indo–European loan. Perhaps, it derives via Phoenician ššmn from Akkadian šamaššammu which can be interpreted  as a compound of  šamnu  [𒉌] fat, oil and šammum  [𒌑] plant; this closely parallels the Sumerian name for sesame, geši [𒄑𒉌], which is composed of two sign geš plant and i₃ oil.  The first element of  šamaššammu derives from a Semitic root ŠMN fat which is common across the Semitic tongues, e. g., Arabic as-samn [السمن] fat, clarified butter, Hebrew shemen [שמן] oil Ugaritic shamn [𐎌𐎎𐎐] oil. Other Semitic forms for sesame are rather close, e. g., Aramaic šumšəm [ܫܘܡܫܡ] or šušma [ܫܘܫܡܐ], Hebrew sumsum  [שומשום] and modern Arabic as-simsim [السمسم]; the distantly related Coptic language has, among similar forms, semsem [ⲥⲉⲙⲥⲏⲙ].          Sesame flower   In some lan­guages of the Middle East, sesame is named dif­ferent­ly: Pashto kunjite [كونجتې], Kazakh künjit [күнжіт], Geor­gian kunjuti [ქუნჯუთი], Turk­men künji and Azer­baijani küncüt evolved via Modern Farsi konjed [کنجد] from Middle Persian kunjid. The word was borrowed by Russian as kunzhut [кунжут] and entered a few more Western languages, like Estonian kunžuut and Yiddish kunzhut [קונזשוט].  In India, where sesame is cultivated since the Harappan period, there are two independent names for it: Sanskrit tila [तिल] appears alredy in the Rigveda and is the source of all names in North India, and some Southern Indian names also, e. g., Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi and Bengali til [तिल, تل, ਤਿਲ, তিল], Gujarati tal [તલ], Sinhala tala [තල] and Dhivehi thileyo [ތިލެޔޮ], but also Telugu tillu [తిలలు]. The origin of that word family is not known, but it often suspected to derive from a pre-Aryan Northern Indian language predating Sanskrit, perhaps related to the contemporary Munda languages. Yet there is a similar Akkadian term tallum meaning oil.           Sesame flower           Sesame flower   In contrast, most of the Dravid­ian languages in South India feature an inde­pendent name for sesame exempli­fied by Tamil and Kannada ellu [எள்ளு, ಎಳ್ಳು]. Quite inter­estingly, the latter name reminds of Greek elaia [ἐλαία] olive and Akkadian ellu fruit, olive, hinting at a possible common origin for the names of two locally important oil crops; but there is also Sumerian ili sesame. While this group of names seems to be ex­clusively associated with Dravidian languages in the South of the sub­continent, a remote connection to the til-words cannot be ruled out completely.           Sesame plants with flowers   From both In­dian roots, words with the gener­alized meaning oil; liquid fat are derived, e. g.,  Sanskrit taila [तैल], Gujarati tel [તેલ] and Dhivehi  theyo [ތެޔޮ] vs.  Tamil enney [என்னெய்], the latter being formed from ellu [எள்ளு] sesame and ney [நெய்] fat; see coconut for the second element. Cf. also Malayalam enna [എണ്ണ] and Kannada enne [ಎಣ್ಣೆ] oil, probably a parallel construction.  Similar semantic shifts from the name of an oil crop to a general word fat, oil are also known for other languages, e. g., olive has given rise to English oil.  English gingelly (now largely obsolete) and Portuguese gergelim (common in Brazil only) have their origin in the early colonial period; their origin is Arabic al-juljulan [الجلجلان] sesame, which allegedly derives from an Arabic noun jaljala [جلجلة] sound, echo, referring to the rattling sound of ripe seeds within the capsule; obviously, the Arabic term has an onomatopoetic character. There are a few cognate names, e. g., Maltese ġulġlien, Hindi gingli [गिंगली] and Spanish ajonjolí. Other, now uncommon, names of sesame in English are tilseed (from Hindi/Urdu til [तिल, تل]) and benseed or benne (from Wolof bene).  A possible Chinese term for sesame is hu ma [胡麻] wild/foreign hemp. In this compound, the element ma means hemp (it can also refer to the numbing taste of  Sichuan pepper), and hu signifies barbarian, foreign (the same sign is used to write black pepper as foreign Sichuan pepper).

Mono­terpenoids occur in traces (β-phell­andrene, cineol, citral). The pungency of ginger is caused by a non-volatile resin containing the same type of hydroxyaryl compounds that are also found in other spices of the ginger family: Zingerone, gingeroles and shogaoles. The pungent gingeroles degrade to the milder shogaoles during storage; high gingerole content and good pungency thus indicate freshness and quality.  See also grains of paradise. ",

    "etymology": "German  Ingwer, English ginger, French gingembre, Italian zenzero and practically all other names of ginger in European languages can, at first, be traced back to Latin zingiber, which was in turn a loan from Greek (zingiberis [ζιγγίβερις]).  Following fur­ther, we arrive in India, which was Europe’s source of ginger in antiquity: The Greek name zingiberis [ζιγγίβερις] is, in fact, quite an accurate repre­sentation of the name of ginger in Indic languages spoken at the same time, e. g., Pali singivera [सिंगिवेर]; the cor­responding Sanskrit form is shringavera [शृंगवेर]. These Indic names used to be explained to mean shaped like a deer’s antler (horn), but they are now thought to be Dravidian loans: In modern Dravidian tongues, the root INCI still denotes ginger, e. g., Malayalam inchi [ഇഞ്ചി] ginger or Tamil inji-ver (ingee-ver) [இஞ்சி வேர்] ginger-root. Cf. also Sinhala and Dhivehi inguru [ඉඟුරු, އިނގުރު].  Initial G in most of the European names of ginger is due to a Late Latin form gingiber, which is, directly or indirectly, the progenitor of today’s European names. In German, the G was lost yielding Middle High German ingber, which is conserved to this day in Yiddish ingber [אינגבער]. The Scandinavian names also lack the G and are probably loans from German or among themselves. The same holds for some West and East Slavonic names, e. g., Polish imbir, Russian and Belarusian imbir [имбирь, імбір] and Ukrainian imbyr [імбир].          Ginger flower (ornamental) perso.wanadoo.fr   Some langua­ges in South-Eastern Central Europe have an initial palatal sound (DY) in their name of ginger: Serbo­croatian and Mace­donian đumbir [ђумбир, ѓумбир], Slovak ďumbier and Hun­garian gyömbér. Probably, there is a common reason for these names, but I don’t known about it.  English ginger (Middle English gingifer, Old English gingivere) goes back to Old French gingivie which, of course, is also the source of Modern French gingembre. The Dutch form gember has conserved the initial G, probably due to influences from Romance languages.  Lastly, Arabic az-zanjabil [الزنجبيل] and Hebrew sangvil [זנגוויל] are also derived from the Indic names. From Arabic, the word was transferred to Persian (zanjabil [زنجبیل]), Kurdish (zanjafil [زةنجةفیل]), Georgian (janjapili [ჯანჯაფილი]), Tigrinya (jinjibil [ጅንጅብል]) and Uighur (sansabil). In the days of the Ottoman Turk Empire, the Turkish name zencefil spread further reaching even South East Europe, e. g.,  Albanian xhenxhefil and Bulgarian dzhindzhifil [джинджифил].           Ginger plant with flowers www.csdl.tamu.edu           Ginger flower kanchanapisek.or.th       © Thai Junior Encyclopedia   Despite the fact that the names of ginger in modern European tongues derive from Old Greek zingiberis [ζιγγίβερις] almost without exception, the modern Greek name is not related (see also parsley and rose for similar cases). Instead, Greek piperoriza [πιπερόριζα] is just a descriptive compound pepperroot, referring to the pungent peppery taste. A similar motivation may lay behind Armenian gojabghbegh [կոճապղպեղ] which, I deem, is composed of goj [կոճ] coil; ankle and bghbegh [պղպեղ] pepper. Interestingly, pepper-root is a name used in many Scandinavian languages for horseradish. See the latter and mugwort for more etymological explanations of root, and see long pepper for pepper.  Likewise, the original Sanskrit term shringavera [शृंगवेर] appears to have left no trace in contemporary North Indian (Aryan) languages. Instead, modern names of ginger derive from two other Sanskrit words ardraka [आर्द्रक] fresh ginger and sunthi [सुंठि] dried ginger. Descendants of these terms (usually in their original meanings) are still in use both in Aryan and Dravidian tongues of India, and even in the geographically more distant Pashto:   languagefresh, greendried  Sanskritardraka  [आर्द्रक]  sunthi [सुंठि] Hindi,Dogriadrakh [अदरख]  sonth [सोंठ] Urdu  adrak [ادرک]    Pashto  adrak [ادرک]   sund [سونډ] Kashmiri  adrak [ادرک]  shounth [شونٹھ] Nepali  aduva [अदुवा]  sutho [सुठो] Gujarati  adu [આદું]  sunth [સૂંઠ] Punjabi  adrak [ਅਦਰਕ]  sund [ਸੂੰਡ] Marathi  ale [आले]  sunth [सुंठ] Bengali  ada [আদা]    Santali  ada, adhe  sut Tamil   ellam [எல்லம்]   sunthi [சுண்டி] Telugu  allamu [అల్లము]  shonti [శొంటి]   As an exception to the rule, Kannada shunthi [ಶುಂಟಿ] refers to ginger in general.  The Bulgarian name isiot [исиот] is a Turkish loan: ısı hot, warm and ot grass. This reference seems to point not so much to the pungent flavour then to the use of ginger in making salep, a hot beverage prepared from Orchis roots and spices.  That name is also found in other South Slavonic languages, but may mean not only ginger but also other pungent plants, e. g., zedoary or chile. In Turkish, isot also means a special type of paprika powder.

In the botanical sense, cones are no fruits, as they do not develop from a ovary (conifers do not enclose their seeds, but develop them open or naked).

Sensory quality Aromatic with a sweet accent, similar to the South Ameri­can pink pepper. See also lico­rice for a dis­cussion of sweet spices. Main constitu­ents Apart from up to 33% sugars and 10% resin, juniper berries owe their use in the kitchen to an essential oil (0.2 to 2%, dependent on provenance). The essential oil is mainly composed of monoterpenes: 80% α- and β-pinene, thujene, sabinene, 5% terpinene-4-ol, α-terpineol, borneol and geraniol; sesqiterpenes (α- and β-cadinene, caryophyllene) are found in traces.           Unripe juniper berries           Ripe juniper cones  Origin Several species of the genus Juni­perus grow all over tem­perate Europe and Asia. Etymology The classical Latin name of that plant, iuni­perus, cannot be ex­plained satis­factorily; possibly, it is a Celtic loan. Other theories assume it is a Latin com­pound: It could be a con­traction of iuveni-parus (too) young (early) bearing, which would refer to the abortive action of the related species Juniperus sabina. Or it could contain iuncus rush, reed, in reference to the flexible branches of juniper usable for plaiting. Also, connections to Iupiter (genetive case: Iovis) have been proposed, which might hint at otherwise unknown cultic uses.  Names of juniper in several European languages, especially Romance languages, derive from that name: Besides English juniper, we have Dutch jeneverbes, Italian ginepro, Spanish enebro (Old Spanish ginebro), Provençal genèbre, Romanian ienupăr and even Hebrew juniper [ג’וניפר]. In English,  the French loan juniper supplanted the Old English name of that plant, cwicbēam life-tree (modern quickbeam), which was also used for rowan (mountain ash, Sorbus aucuparia).           Juniper tree in column-shape © Martin Flux, Head Gardener, Fishbourne Roman Palace           Juniper tree with ripe cones   The German name Wachol­der (of which Machan­del is a Northern variant) contains a stem which might be related to wachsen grow (cf. English wax increase), but is more probably derived from the Proto-Indo–European root WEG weave, web (cf. English veil,  wick), since its branches have been used for weaving. Incidentally,  the same root also lies behind English wax as in beewax.  The Germanic tree suffix d(e)r, as seen in Wachol­der,  appears in several other German plant names. At the bottom lies Proto-Indo–European  DERU with the basic meaning tree, particularly oak and the derived meaning strong, firm, reliable. This is a very prominent root, which hardly any Indo–European language is free of: Gothic triu tree, wood, Sanskrit darvi [दर्वि] wooden, Farsi dar [دار] wood, Greek drys [δρῦς] (Mycenaean drus [𐀉𐀬]) tree, oak, Old Irish daur oak, Russian derevo [дерево] tree, Latvian darva tar, furthermore Latin durus strong, robust, Lithuanian drūtas thick, strong and Old English trum strong, firm. Examples from Modern English include tree, tray, tar, true and trust.  In some Middle Eastern languages, cinnamon bears the name Chinese wood, where the latter element is represented by words of the DERU kin, e. g., Hindi dal chini [दालचीनी]. See cassia for a more detailed discussion. Another spice plant name which might derive from that root is laurel.

    "origin": "Several species of the genus Juni­perus grow all over tem­perate Europe and Asia. ",
    "etymology": "The classical Latin name of that plant, iuni­perus, cannot be ex­plained satis­factorily; possibly, it is a Celtic loan. Other theories assume it is a Latin com­pound: It could be a con­traction of iuveni-parus (too) young (early) bearing, which would refer to the abortive action of the related species Juniperus sabina. Or it could contain iuncus rush, reed, in reference to the flexible branches of juniper usable for plaiting. Also, connections to Iupiter (genetive case: Iovis) have been proposed, which might hint at otherwise unknown cultic uses.  Names of juniper in several European languages, especially Romance languages, derive from that name: Besides English juniper, we have Dutch jeneverbes, Italian ginepro, Spanish enebro (Old Spanish ginebro), Provençal genèbre, Romanian ienupăr and even Hebrew juniper [ג’וניפר]. In English,  the French loan juniper supplanted the Old English name of that plant, cwicbēam life-tree (modern quickbeam), which was also used for rowan (mountain ash, Sorbus aucuparia).           Juniper tree in column-shape © Martin Flux, Head Gardener, Fishbourne Roman Palace           Juniper tree with ripe cones   The German name Wachol­der (of which Machan­del is a Northern variant) contains a stem which might be related to wachsen grow (cf. English wax increase), but is more probably derived from the Proto-Indo–European root WEG weave, web (cf. English veil,  wick), since its branches have been used for weaving. Incidentally,  the same root also lies behind English wax as in beewax.  The Germanic tree suffix d(e)r, as seen in Wachol­der,  appears in several other German plant names. At the bottom lies Proto-Indo–European  DERU with the basic meaning tree, particularly oak and the derived meaning strong, firm, reliable. This is a very prominent root, which hardly any Indo–European language is free of: Gothic triu tree, wood, Sanskrit darvi [दर्वि] wooden, Farsi dar [دار] wood, Greek drys [δρῦς] (Mycenaean drus [𐀉𐀬]) tree, oak, Old Irish daur oak, Russian derevo [дерево] tree, Latvian darva tar, furthermore Latin durus strong, robust, Lithuanian drūtas thick, strong and Old English trum strong, firm. Examples from Modern English include tree, tray, tar, true and trust.  In some Middle Eastern languages, cinnamon bears the name Chinese wood, where the latter element is represented by words of the DERU kin, e. g., Hindi dal chini [दालचीनी]. See cassia for a more detailed discussion. Another spice plant name which might derive from that root is laurel.

    "etymology": "The source of the name lavender is commonly assumed to be Latin lavare wash, referring to lavender’s use in bath essences. Yet against this can be argued that no ancient source men­tions such an appli­cation of lavender.  Most European and even some non-European languages have very similar names for lavender, e. g., German Lavendel, Spanish lavanda, Romanian levănțică (levănţică), Latvian lavandīna, Slovenian lavendin, Slovak levanduľa, Finnish laventeli, Bulgarian lavan­dula [лаван­дула], Greek le­vanta [λε­βάντα], Turkish lavânta çiçeği and Hebrew laven­der [לבנדר]          Spanish lavender, L. stoechas   The name of lavender in Farsi, ustukhuduz [اسطوخودوس], is adapted from the Classical Greek name of the related Spanish Lavender (L. stoechas) which was known as stoichas [στοιχάς]. That name derives from the desig­nation Stoichades nesoi [Στοιχάδες νῆσοι] Stochadic Islands for a group of islands off the French Riviera coast. The three small islands are arranged in a straight line, which gave  them their ancient name: Greek stoichos [στοῖχος] line, row, order, from the Proto-Indo–European root steigʰ stride. The area is still famous for its wild lavender; a nearby commune is known as Le Lavandou.  Arabic al-khuzaama [الخزامى] and Armenian husam [հուսամ] are probably shortened versons of the Farsi name. The Arabic word has been transferred to the Iberian peninsula, where it emerges as alfazema and (rarer) Spanish alhucema. The shift from Arabic خ or  ح to Portuguese f is often observed in Arabic loanwords; it might indicate a transfer route via Spanish (that shifts Common Romance f- into h-), followed by hypercorrection in Portuguese.  See also caper about other Arabic loanwords in Iberic languages.  The Greek term stoichas also ended up in another Middle Eastern language: In a Latin–Coptic dictionary from 1840, I found the entry stoi [ⲥⲧⲟⲓ], which was glossed as hyssop. Maybe this is a botanical error, but that name reappeared in the name of mint (asinstoi [ⲁⲥⲓⲛⲥⲧⲟⲓ]), so it is possible that it had acquired a wider meaning in Coptic, encompassing several Lamiaceae herbs.

    "used-plant--part": "Nutmeg is not a nut, but the kernel of an apricot-like fruit. Mace is an arillus, a thin leathery tissue between the stone and the pulp; it is bright red to purple when harvested, but after drying changes to amber. In the nutmeg trade, broken nutmegs that have been infested by pests are referred to as BWP grade (broken, wormy and punky). BWP grade nutmegs must be used only for distillation of oil of nutmeg and extraction of nutmeg oleoresin. Occasionally, however, they are ground and sold illegally. For the very real danger of molds producing aflatoxines on BWP nuts, consumers should buy their nutmegs as a whole, and grind for themselves. Whole nutmegs will also keep their flavour much longer. The pulp of the nutmeg fruit is tough, almost woody, and very sour. In Indonesia, it is used to make a delicious jam with pleasant nutmeg aroma (selei buah pala). Other uses of the pulp are not known to me.          Unripe nutmeg fruit opened to expose the aril (mace) and seed  Plant family Myri­sticaceae (nutmeg family) Sensory quality Both spices are strongly aromatic, resinous and warm in taste. Mace is generally said to have a finer aroma than nutmeg, but the difference is small. Nutmeg quickly loses its fragrance when ground; therefore, the necessary amount should be grated from a whole nut immediately before usage.           Ripe nutmeg split open. Both the kernel and the mace can be seen.           Ripe nutmeg fruit © Josh Weber           Unripe nutmeg fruit opened to expose the aril (mace) and seed  Main constit­uents Nutmeg con­tains about 10% essen­tial oil, which is mostly com­posed of terpene hydro­carbons (sabinene and pinenes; further­more camphene, p‑cymene, phell­andrene, terpinene, limonene, myrcene, together 60 to 80%), terpene derivatives (linalool, geraniol, terpineol, together 5 to 15%) and phenyl­propanoids (myristicin, elemicin, safrol, eugenol and eugenol derivatives, together 15 to 20%). Of the latter group, myristicin (methoxy-safrole, typically 4%) is responsible for the hallucinogenic effect of  nutmeg.          Ripe nutmeg fruit © Josh Weber   Nutmeg is on­ly weak­ly hal­lucino­genic; there­fore one needs large dosage (typi­cally, one half to one nut is used for a trip). The large dosage may give rise to very un­pleasant side-effects caused by other com­ponents of nutmeg, which in­clude pro­longed extreme nausea and long-term hyper­sensitivity to nut­meg. The hallucino­genic phenyl­propanoids them­selves are hepato­toxins and far from harmless for frequent users.  Oil of mace (up to 12% in the spice) contains the same aroma com­ponents, but the total fraction of terpenoids is in­creased to almost 90% at the cost of the phenyl­propanoids (10%).  Both nutmeg and mace contain about 2% of lignanes (diaryl­propanoids), which are non­volatile dimers of phenyl­propanoid con­stituents of the essential oil, e. g., dehydro­diisoeugenol.          Flowers of nutmeg           Flowers of the nutmeg tree  Origin Naturally, nutmeg is limited to the Banda Islands, a tiny archi­pelago in Eastern Indonesia (Moluccas). Main producing countries today are Indonesia (East Indian Nutmeg) and Grenada (West Indian Nutmeg); while Indonesian nutmegs are mainly exported to Europe and Asia, Grenada nutmeg mostly finds its way into the USA.           Flowers of nutmeg           Flowers of the nutmeg tree           The flag of Grenada shows a nutmeg, the islands main export item   Nutmegs are graded ac­cording to their size. Larger nut­megs with a mass around 8 g are con­sidered superior and are traded at higher price. Especi­ally in Grenada, it is common to specify the size of nut­megs as the number of dried nut­megs per British pound; ac­cording­ly, the best qualities are re­fer­red to as 55’ nuts (8.2 g) to 65’ nuts (7.0 g). The smallest grades traded in native state are 160’ nuts at only 2.8 g. Even smaller nutmegs and nutmeg fragments are included into the BWP grade which is the lowest quality.   Two more nutmeg species are found as adulterants of true nutmeg or mace: M. argentea (Macassar Nutmeg, Papua Nutmeg) from New Guinea and M. malabarica (Bombay Nutmeg, Wild Nutmeg) from South India. While the latter lacks fragrance, the former is described as pungent and wintergreen-like. Both adulterants can be identified by their seeds’ shape: Whereas true Banda nutmegs are shaped globularly to egg-like, with their largest dimension at most 50% longer than the smallest, the two other species feature strongly prolate seeds more reminiscent to acorns (oak seeds) than eggs.           Drying mace           Nutmeg harvest: Nutmegs and purple mace  Etymology In many Euro­pean coun­tries, the name of nutmeg derives from Latin nux muscatus musky nut; moschate nut:, often with omission or adaptation of the nut part: Danish muskat­nød, Yiddish mushkat [מושקאַט], Finnish muskotti­pähkin, French muscade, Latvian muskat­rieksts, Slovak muškátový orech, Russian muskatnyj orekh [мускатный орех], Greek moscho­karido [μοσχο­κάρυδο], Georgian musk’at’i [მუსკატი], Armenian meshgen­gous [մշկընկոյզ] and Hebrew egoz muskat [אגוז מוסקט]. The direct progenitor of English nutmeg is Middle English notemugge.          Ripe nutmeg split open pharm1.pharmazie.uni-greifswald.de   The term musk refers to an aroma obtained, since antiquity, from the musk deer, a dog-sized animal native to the Himalayas. The name musk comes, via Latin muscus, from Greek moschos [μόσχος] which itself was borrowed from Persian musk (modern Farsi moshk [مشک]).

Examples of names of that type still in use are Turkish hindistan­cevizi, Bulgarian indijsko orekhche [индийско орехче] and Farsi jowz hendi [جوز هندی].

Note  that English is actually one of the few European langages that does not use names of this kind. Rather, the English term nutmeg flower may mean a completely unrelated plant, nigella.  The genus na­me Myristica derives from Greek myron [μύρον] balm, chrism, ointment, which might be a Semitic loan and thus related to Hebrew mor [מר] myrrh, which derives from a Common Semitic root MRR bitter.

    "sensory-quality": "Both spices are strongly aromatic, resinous and warm in taste. Mace is generally said to have a finer aroma than nutmeg, but the difference is small. Nutmeg quickly loses its fragrance when ground; therefore, the necessary amount should be grated from a whole nut immediately before usage.           Ripe nutmeg split open.

    "main-constit­uents": "Nutmeg con­tains about 10% essen­tial oil, which is mostly com­posed of terpene hydro­carbons (sabinene and pinenes; further­more camphene, p‑cymene, phell­andrene, terpinene, limonene, myrcene, together 60 to 80%), terpene derivatives (linalool, geraniol, terpineol, together 5 to 15%) and phenyl­propanoids (myristicin, elemicin, safrol, eugenol and eugenol derivatives, together 15 to 20%). Of the latter group, myristicin (methoxy-safrole, typically 4%) is responsible for the hallucinogenic effect of  nutmeg.          Ripe nutmeg fruit © Josh Weber   Nutmeg is on­ly weak­ly hal­lucino­genic; there­fore one needs large dosage (typi­cally, one half to one nut is used for a trip). The large dosage may give rise to very un­pleasant side-effects caused by other com­ponents of nutmeg, which in­clude pro­longed extreme nausea and long-term hyper­sensitivity to nut­meg. The hallucino­genic phenyl­propanoids them­selves are hepato­toxins and far from harmless for frequent users.  Oil of mace (up to 12% in the spice) contains the same aroma com­ponents, but the total fraction of terpenoids is in­creased to almost 90% at the cost of the phenyl­propanoids (10%).  Both nutmeg and mace contain about 2% of lignanes (diaryl­propanoids), which are non­volatile dimers of phenyl­propanoid con­stituents of the essential oil, e. g., dehydro­diisoeugenol.

The smallest grades traded in native state are 160’ nuts at only 2.8 g. Even smaller nutmegs and nutmeg fragments are included into the BWP grade which is the lowest quality.

    "origin": "South and South­east Asia. Wild mango trees are known only from North-East India and Burma, and so it appears plaus­ible that the species evolved there. Etymology The name mango, almost identical in countless languages, is derived from Tamil, the most important language of Southern India, and was transferred to the West by the Portuguese. The general term for mango in Tamil is mamaran [மாமரம்], but the fruit is usually referred to either as manpalam (also transcribed mambazham [மாம்பழம்]) ripe mango fruit or mangai [மாங்காய்] unripe mango fruit. It appears that the latter term was picked up by Portuguese sailors who encountered the fruits at harbours and markets; perhaps, mangoes were dominantly traded in the unripe state at that time.  The North Indian names for mango derive from Sanskrit amra [आम्र], itself probably a Dravidian loan and thus related to the Tamil words noted in the previous paragraph, and even to English mango. Only Hindi amchur (also transcribed aamchoor) [आम्चूर] refers to the dried spice, whereas Hindi am [आम] means the fresh fruits.  Sanskrit names like madhulaka [मधूलक] refer to the sweet taste (madhu [मधु] sweet). See licorice and bear’s garlic for related words.  The genus name Mangifera (bringer of mango) contains Latin ferre carry, bring (see also asafetida), cf. Lucifer bringer of light or Christopher he who carries Christ.

The general term for mango in Tamil is mamaran [மாமரம்], but the fruit is usually referred to either as manpalam (also transcribed mambazham [மாம்பழம்]) ripe mango fruit or mangai [மாங்காய்] unripe mango fruit. It appears that the latter term was picked up by Portuguese sailors who encountered the fruits at harbours and markets; perhaps, mangoes were dominantly traded in the unripe state at that time.  The North Indian names for mango derive from Sanskrit amra [आम्र], itself probably a Dravidian loan and thus related to the Tamil words noted in the previous paragraph, and even to English mango. Only Hindi amchur (also transcribed aamchoor) [आम्चूर] refers to the dried spice, whereas Hindi am [आम] means the fresh fruits.  Sanskrit names like madhulaka [मधूलक] refer to the sweet taste (madhu [मधु] sweet). See licorice and bear’s garlic for related words.  The genus name Mangifera (bringer of mango) contains Latin ferre carry, bring (see also asafetida), cf. Lucifer bringer of light or Christopher he who carries Christ.  "

",
    "origin": "Several species of genus Origanum are native to the Medi­terranean, all of which are traded as a spice. The influence of climate, season and soil on the composition of the essential oil is greater than the difference between the various species.             Oregano plant with flowers            Flowers of Nepali oregano            Oregano native to Nepal   The most impor­tant species are O. vulgare (pan-Euro­pean, Asian), O. onites (Greece, Asia Minor) and O. hera­cleoticum (Italy, Balkan pen­insular, West Asia). A close­ly related plant is  mar­joram from Asia Minor, which, how­ever, diff­ers signi­ficantly in taste, because phenolic com­pounds are missing in its es­sential oil. Some breeds show an flavour inter­mediate between oregano and mar­joram (gold marjoram = gold oregano).  Mexican Oregano stems from the plant Lippia graveolens (Verbenaceae) and is closely related to lemon verbena. Although only loosely related to oregano, Mexican oregano displays a flavour very similar to that of oregano, albeit stronger.  It is increasingly traded, especially in the US. Its strong aroma makes it an acceptable substitute for epazote leaves if the latter are not available; this wouldn’t work the other way round, though.  There is a sig­nificant taxo­nomic confusion about the term oregano in Mexican cooking. Several plants are named thus in different parts of México, and there is little clear information about those. Some plants that have been identified as Mexican Oregano are Poliomintha longiflora, Lippia berlandieri and Plectranthus amboinicus (syn. Coleus aromaticus).          Oregano native to Nepal  Etymology The Greek name ori­ganon [ὀρί­γανον] might well contain oros [ὄρος]  moun­tain, and the verb ganou­sthai [γανοῦ­σθαι] delight in, be­cause oregano  pre­fers higher alti­tude in Medi­terra­nean climate. Some Scandi­navian names also contain an element of that kind: Nor­wegian bergmynte and Icelandic berg­minta moun­tain mint and  Finnish mäki­meirami hill marjoram; a parallel forma­tion exists in Farsi, avishan kuhi [آویشن کوهی] mountain marjoram. Oregano  is indeed related to mint and marjoram, be­longing to the same plant family Lamia­ceae.  Yet that explanation also has its faults. First, the ancient plant called origanon [ὀρίγανον] is not clearly identified; it could well have been a related species, e. g., marjoram, as the two have often been confused in the course of history. Second, a pre-Greek origin of origanon has also been suggested (possibly dervied from a Semitic tongue of Western Asia or Northern Africa). Confusingly, rosemary bears names with the element mountain in Arabic and Farsi.  Names for Oregano in the large majority of European languages are very similar, or even the same: The spice is named oregano not only in English, but also in German, Danish, Polish and even Hebrew (written אורגנו). Minor spelling modification occur some other languages, e. g., Czech oregáno, Spanish orégano, Icelandic oreganó, Italian origano, Catalan orenga, Irish Gaelic oragán and Portuguese orégão. Only a few languages have the name significantly changed: Maltese riegnu and Greek rigani [ρίγανη], which was transferred to Albanian (rigon) and Bulgarian (rigan [риган]).  Many tongues name oregano as wild marjoram, e. g., German wilder Majoran, Swedish vild mejram, Hungarian vadmajoránna, Polish dziki majeranek, Provençal majurano fero and French  marjolaine sauvage and  marjolaine bâtarde (bastard marjoram). This is botanically incorrect, because although oregano and marjoram are indeed closely related, one cannot identify the former as the wild form of the latter.

    "sensory-qual­ity": "Charac­teristically pure and refreshing odour, pungent and burning taste.

The double­mint flavour of spear­mint is difficult to de­scribe; it’s minty but not pungent.           Pineapple mint (sterile twig)           Spearmint, a characteristically scented variety of M. spicata           Pineapple mint (sterile twig)   There are, how­ever, yet other mint cultivars whose fragrance bears no similarity with tradi­tional mint aroma: Orange mint (M. citrata, also called Eau de Cologne mint,        similar to the bergamot orange used to        flavour Earl Grey tea), apple mint (M. rotundifolia =        M. longifolia × M. suaveolens,        very mild, slightly minty, not reminiscent to apples), ginger mint (M. gentilis =        M. arvensis ×  M. spicata,        neither minty nor ginger-like at all) and pineapple mint (M. suaveolens, weakly pineapple-like) These plants are more used as tea herbs than for culinary purposes; still,  gifted cooks may  find effective applications. ",
    "main-constituents": "The essential oil of peppermint (up to 2.5% in the dried leaves) is mostly made up from menthol (ca. 50%), menthone (10 to 30%), menthyl esters (up to 10%) and further monoterpene derivatives (pulegone, piperitone, menthofurane). Traces of jasmone (0.1%) improve the oil’s quality remarkably.  Menthol and menthyl acetate are responsible for the pungent and refreshing odour; they are mostly found in older leaves and are preferentially formed during long daily sunlight periods. On the other hand, the ketones menthone and pulegone (and menthofurane) have a less delightful fragrance; they appear to higher fraction in young leaves and their formation is preferred during short days.           Japanese mint           Pineapple mint with flowers   The world’s most im­por­tant source of menthol is, how­ever, not pepper­mint but field mint. Field mint is the only mint species that became natural­ized in tropical Asia; there are many dif­ferent culti­vars, some of which are grown for direct con­sump­tion, others for the distilla­tion of essen­tial oil. The Ja­panese variety of field mint (Mentha arvensis var. piper­ascens Malinv. ex Holmes), now grown in many Asian countries, may contain up to 5% of essential oil in its tips; more common, however, are 1 to 2%. Chief com­ponent of the oil is menthol (50 to 70%, in rare cases up to 90%). After parts of the menthol have been removed from the oil, the oil is marketed as (dementholized, recti­fied) Japanese peppermint oil; it typically contains 30 to 45% menthol, 17 to 35% menthone, 5 to 13% menthyl acetate, 2 to 5% limonene and 2.5 to 4% neomenthol. Other terpenes occur but in traces (piperitone, pulegone, β-caryophyllene, β-caryophyllene-epoxide, α-pinene, β-pinene, germacrene D, 1,8-cineol, linalool, menthofurane, camphene). A trace component characteristic for this species and missing in other mints is β-hexenyl phenylacetate.          Pineapple mint with flowers   The oil of this so-called Japanese pepper­mint is often attri­buted with an in­credible wealth of useful medical properties; it is even more in­credible, though, that it never failed to help me in a number of dif­ferent in­conve­nient con­ditions like nausea, mild stomach upset or cold.  The menthol obtained as a by-product in the recti­fication of Japanese pepper­mint oil is used for medical products and for chewing gum. A com­parative­ly small fraction goes in the pro­duction of menthol-flavoured cigarettes, which have been quite popular in Western Europe a few decades ago. See tonka bean for more on flavoured tobacco products.           Pennyroyal (M. pulegium) was a popular culinary herb in ancient Rome (see also silphion)           Moroccan green mint (sterile plant)   Whenever high­ly concentrated menthol is used, one must consider that menthol is toxic to infants; there are rumors that it can induce apnoea.  Other mints may contain rather dif­ferent con­stituents: Mentha pulegium (penny­royal) con­tains 80% pulegone, and M. crispa (crispate mint) con­tains 50% carvone. Another famed cultivar, spear­mint, owes its phantastic aroma to carvone, limonene, dihydro­carvone, men­thone, pule­gone, 1,8-cineol and β-pinene. ",
    "origin": "Pepper­mint is a (usually sterile) hybrid from water mint (M. aquatica)  and spearmint (M. spicata). It is found sometimes wild in Central and South­ern Europe, but was probably first put to human use  in Eng­land, whence its culti­vation spread to the Euro­pean con­tinent and Africa; today, Northern Africa is a main culti­vation area. Other mint species are indi­genous to Europe and Asia, and some are used since mill­ennia. Cultivars in tropical Asia always derive from field mint and are, there­fore, botani­cally not closely related to Euro­pean pepper­mint, although they come close to pepper­mint in their culinary value. Mints from Western and Central Asia, however, are com­parable not to pepper­mint but to horse­mint and apple­mint.  All species of genus Mentha are aromatic, although not in all of them the aroma is that pure than in peppermint. As a rule of thumb, any mint can be substituted by peppermint, but not always vice versa.           Curly mint, M. spicata var. crispa           Flowering horsemint, M. longifolia           Water mint, M. aquatica  ",
    "etymology": "The names for mint are fairly uniform in most Euro­pean lan­guages: German Minze, Danish and Nor­wegian mynte, Dutch munt, Basque menda, Estonian münt, Finnish minttu, Czech máta, Polish mięta, Russian myata [мята], Lithuanian mėta, Latvian mētra, French menthe and Italian menta. All these names derive from Latin mentha mint.  The Latin name mentha itself was borrowed from Greek minthe [μίνθη], whose origin is, however, unknown. It is already found in Mycenaean, the earliest recorded version of Greek, as mintha [𐀖𐀲].          Flowering horsemint, M. longifolia   The English ho­mo­nym meaning place where coins are pro­duced or the cor­respon­ding verb are not at all related to the name of the plants; rather, they derive (together with the more familiar money) from the epo­nymous Latin noun moneta, itself being derived from an epi­thet of the god­dess Juno, in whose temple coins were minted.  The pepper-element in peppermint, found in many other languages and also in the botanical species epithet, piperita, refers to the  peppery and pungent taste of this specific mint type.  See also long pepper for the etymology of pepper.          Water mint, M. aquatica   In the New Testa­ment, the mint is called hedy­osmon [ἡδύ­οσμον] (see also pome­granate). This com­pound means the sweet smelling one: hedys [ἡδύς] sweet, pleasant (see licorice for more infor­mation) and osme [ὀσμή] smell, related to English odour, cf. Latin olere to smell. In modern lan­guages, names de­rived thence have the meaning green mint, spearmint, not pepper­mint, e. g., Greek diosmos [δυόσμος] and Bulgarian giozum or dzhodzhen [джоджен].  In Semitic tongues, closely similar names for mint may be observed: Arabic an-na'na' [النعناع], Aramaic nanea [ܢܢܥܐ] Hebrew nana [נענע], Maltese nagħniegħ and Tigrinya naenae [ናዕናዕ]; there are also similar forms in languages outside the Afro-Asiatic family, e. g., Turkish nane, Albanian  nenexhiku, Pashto nauna and Farsi nana [نعناع]. I don’t know about the exact origin of that group of words, yet it is of ancient origin as testified by Akkadian nīnū.

Mexican pepper leaf plant   The canonical substitute for pepper leaves that is widely used even in México are avocado leaves, but only Mexican avocado types (Persea drimy­folia) have scented foliage; avocados from other regions are mostly Persea americana with insipid leaves.

Indeed, their safrole content is rather high and not completely without risk, although Mexicans don’t care much about it.

The (rare) English term eared pepper is open to mis­under­standig, because English ear has two distinct meanings organ for hearing and inflores­cence/infrutes­cence of various plants, particularly cereals. The two are actually chance homonyms and derive from dif­ferent Proto-Indo–European roots: H₂EUS ear (for hearing) (cf. aural), but H₂EḰ sharp, pointed (cf. acute or acid).          Mexican pepperleaf (hoja santa), plant with flower   In the case of Mexican pepper, actually both inter­preta­tions would make sense: The inflores­cence con­forms to the botanical defini­tion of ear (it is compact along one stem), and the leaves blades have two large lobes directed back­wards which is com­monly refer­red to as eared (thus, all heart-shaped leaves are eared). As can be seen from the Latin species epithet auritus, the latter meaning is the intended one (the other meaning of ear would be expressed by spicatus in Latin, from spica ear (of grain), from Proto-Indo–European spei sharp).  I cannot explain the Spanish name hoja santa sacred leaf; maybe this hints at cultic use of this plant in Aztec rituals. The English name root beer plant is motivated by the olfactory similarity to sassafras, which is used to prepare the US softdrink root beer.

Related species are Chinese Mustard, S. cernua (syn. Brassica cernua), from China and  rocket, Eruca sativa (syn. Brassica eruca), from Southern and Eastern Europe. ",
    "etymology": "See black mustard.  Most names for white mustard contain an element white, bright which distinguishes white mustard from its black relatives. In some languages, the epithet is yellow instead, e. g., Arabic hardal asfur [خردل اصفر] (see also safflower), Finnish keltasinappi and Hungarian sárga mustár. Yet, in most of these languages, both denominations yellow mustard and white mustard are valid.  The colour adjective white is common to all Germanic languages (Old English hwīt, German weiß, Old High German hwīʒ, Yiddish vays [װײַס], Icelandic hvítur, Swedish vit). The Common Germanic root is HWEITA white, which itself can be related to an Proto-Indo–European root ḰWEI or ḰEU shine. The name of the cereal wheat comes from the same root and refers to the bright white colour of wheat flour. In North Germanic tongues, the names of garlic involve a white element.           White mustard (flowers and dry fruits)           White mustard, flowering plants           White mustard plants bearing ripening fruits   Also, the Slavonic lan­guages feature closely related words for white: Polish biały, Slovak biele, Russian bielyj [белый], Bela­rusian bely [белы], and Bul­garian byal [бял] all have a Com­mon Sla­vonic root form BEL’ white. The Baltic terms Lithua­nian baltas and Latvian balts belong to the same group, as do the English toponyms Baltic (perhaps from a desig­nation White Sea for the Baltic Sea) and Belarus (white Russia). Also in English, related words are found, which donote colours in wider sense: bleach, blond, blue (see also blue fenu­greek) and even, most sur­prisingly, black (see nigella). The Proto-Indo–European root can be recon­structed as BʰEL fire, shine. The Romance forms Italian bianco, Portuguese branco, French blanc and Spanish blanco are actually Germanic loans. The Common Germanic root BLANKA shiny is still found in Modern English in words like blink, blaze or blank (meaning empty, as white is devoid of colours). Traced further back, the terms are seen to derive from the versatile root BʰEL discussed in the previous paragraph.  The original Latin term for white was albus, which is conserved only in the East Romance tongues (Romanian alb). The Proto-Indo–European form can be reconstructed as H₂ELBʰO white; yet it has exclusively Western distribution, being found in toponyms like the river Elbe and the Alps mountains,  moreover Old Greek alphos [ἀλφός] white leprosity (cf. Albino) Therefore, it has been suspected to be rather a loan from an Old European tongue. The word also underlies Old Norse álfr and Old English ælf frightening supernatural creature and its Modern English translation elf. Elves seem to have been associated with fog, thus the whitish name. In the German Nibelungenlied, there is a character Alberich belonging to a group of dwarves (generally similar to elves in Nordic mythology) called Nibelungs (Old Norse njōl, Latin nebula fog, mist).  Elves appear often in pre-Christian Germanic traditions; they were considered a powerful, dangerous race harrassing humans, as exemplified by Old English ylfa gescot sudden pain or illness (literally elf-shot, as if caused by an invisible elven archer) and German Albtraum nightmare (literally elf-dream, invoking the image of a powerful sprite sitting on a sleeper’s chest).  A negative and condemning view on elves is found in the Beowulf poem, where eotenas ond ylfe ond orcnēas giants and elves and evil spirits are numbered among the descendents of Cain, the primeval murderer.  English elf almost went extinct over the centuries, and was revived in the 16.th century, at the same time shifting in meaning to friendly, small-sized spirit. Yet even these diminished later elves have linguistic ties to their more powerful cousins of old: Cute Oberon, the Elvish King in Shakespeare’s Midsummer Night’s Dream, still carries the same name as the more warlike Alberich (Old French Alberon).

",
    "etymology": "In Latin tongue, the plant was called rosmarinus; most sources interpret this as made from ros dew (akin to Sanskrit rasa [रस] sap, juice) and marinus belonging to the sea (from Latin mare sea, derived from the Proto-Indo–European root MORI water; lake; cf. marine and mermaid).  Truly, rosemary often grows at low altitude and therefore near the sea. It does, however, not typically populate the coast, where the spray of sea water might motivate the name dew of the sea. Possibly, the name refers not to the habitat but to the sea-blue flowers of rosemary. It has been argued that rosmarinus itself is a product of folk etymology. Possible candidates for the original  name are Greek rhops [ῥώψ] shrub and myron [μύρον] balm,  which make a good name for the aromatic plant, but pose more linguistic  problems (see also nutmeg for the etymology of myron). Lastly, the Greek name of sumac, rhous [ῥοῦς], is sometimes set into relation with rosmarinus.  Most European languages have names for rosemary that still much resemble the original Latin rosmarinus: German Rosmarin, Finnish rosmariini, Italian ramerino, Spanish romero, Basque erromero, Albanian rozmarinë, Serbo-Croatian ružmarin [рузмарин], Bulgarian rozmarin [розмарин] and Greek rozmari [ροζμαρί]. In Greek, however, it is more common to call rosemary dendrolivano [δεντρολίβανο], which literally mean incense tree:  livani [λιβάνι] incense und dendro [δέντρο] tree. See also juniper for the linguistic affiliation of the latter.             Sterile rosemary shrub            Rosemary             Rosemary flowers   Arabic al-iklil al-jabal [الإكليل الجبل] and Persian  eklil kuhi [اکلیل کوهی] both mean crown of the moun­tain, but I cannot get what these names is refer­ring to. Short­ened to  al-iklil [الإكليل] the crown, the Arabic name is the source of the modern Portu­guese name of rose­mary, al­ecrim. See also caper for further Iberic loans of Arabic plant names.  Strange­ly, there is a related herb whose name is also often con­nected to mountain without con­vincing semantic ex­planation: oregano is often suspected to derive Greek oros [ὄρος] mountain. "

The best oils can have mild or strong flavour that ranges some­where between floral, fruity or fresh. Poor qualities have pungent, acidic, rancid or even no aroma. ",
    "main-constituents": "In leaves and fruits of the olive tree, a phenolic seco-iridoid called oleuropein is found; it is the hypotensive principle. Before pickling olives, the oleuropein is removed either by treatment with lye or by lactic fermentation; the remaining residues of oleuropein are sometimes said to prevent diseases resulting from high blood pressure.          Olive branch with unripe fruit   Olive oil is ob­tained from the meso­carp (pulp) of special varieties of olives with rather small fruits; the meso­carp contains about 55% of oil.  In the past, olive oil was extracted in hydraulic presses, like most other vegetable oils (see sesame); from that time stems the term cold-pressed for the first fractions with best flavour, which were extracted at low temperature and less than 50 bar pressure (Italian olio extra vergine di oliva, Greek partheno elaiolado [παρθένο ελαιόλαδο]).           Olive branch with unripe fruits           Olive branch with unripe fruit   Today, how­ever, olive oil is almost ex­clusively obtained by centri­fugation, which allows much better yield without applying elevated tem­perature. Con­sequently, almost all olive oil in the food sector is cold-pressed olive oil.  The very best quality (dripping oil) is produced without centrifugation, by sedimentation only; it is rare and expensive. The best quality produced in mass scale is called native olive oil extra in the countries of the European Union; native extra loosely corresponds to the more historic term extra vergine. Both native olive oil extra and the next quality class, native olive oil, must be produced without applying heat, and must not be refined. Products called simply olive oil, however, have usually been refined and often contain small amounts of native oils to improve the flavour.  Olive oil is composed, like all vegetable oils (see also sesame), of fatty acids bound to the alcohol glycerol. Typically, the following fatty acids are found in olive oil: 66% oleic acid, 12% linoleic acid, 9% palmitic acid, 5% eicosenoic acid and 5% palmitoleic acid. Olive oil may contain up to 1.5% of an acyclic triterpene hydrocarbon, squalene.           Ripe olive           Flowering olive branch   The most im­portant parameter for the quality of olive oils is the content of free fatty acids, which must be below 0.8% for native olive oil extra, but may be up to 2% for native olive oil. Free fatty acids are formed in the ground olive paste by action of enzymes (lipases) contained in the olive fruits. The only way to control their formation is cooling and quick extraction. Free fatty acids are unwanted because they lower the smoke point and contribute off-flavour.  The desired flavour of olive oil is dominated by aldehydes (hexanal and 2-hexenal). Furthermore, higher aldehydes, primary alcohols (mainly C6 compounds like hexanol, 2-hexene-1-ol, 3-hexene-1-ol) and their acetic acid esters contribute to the characteristic olive oil aroma. Lastly, hemiterpenoid volatiles were found (3-methyl butanal, 4-methoxy-2-methyl-butanethiol, ethyl esters of 2- and 3-methyl butyric acid). The flavour components, however, depend on variety and geographic origin of the oil.  The typical olive oil colour is due to plant pigments of the carotenoid series (β-carotene, phytofluene, ξ-carotene, lutein, auroxanthin, luteoxanthin, violaxanthin, neoxanthin, neochrome), which contribute a yellow hue, and greenish to brown porphyrines (chlorophyll a and b, and pheophytine a and b). Chlorophyll content may be as high as 10 ppm. ",
    "origin": "Cultivation of the olive tree is known in the Eastern Medi­terranean since five millennia. Whether the plant really stems from these regions or is a native to Central Asia is subject to debate.           Olivenblüten           Olive flowers  ",
    "etymology": "Olive is a loan from Latin oliva olive; olive tree, which itself was derived from Greek: elais [ἐλαίς] olive tree and elaia [ἐλαία] (from older elaiva [ἐλαίϝα], Mycenaean elaiwa [𐀁𐀨𐀷, 𐀁𐁉𐀷, 𐂐]) olive; olive tree; furthermore elaion [ἔλαιον] (Mycenaean elaiwon [𐀁𐀨𐀺, 𐀁𐁉𐀺, 𐂕]) olive oil.  These words are not Indo–European in origin; it is generally accepted that they were transferred to Greek by some Eastern Mediterranean language, often assumed to be Semitic. Yet as we don’t know the botanical origin of the olive tree, the name could, together with the tree, have travelled from more distant Eastern regions. There is a curious connection to the Dravidian languages which are today spoken in Southern India: Sesame, an important local source of vegetable oil, bears names that are remarkably similar to Greek elaia, e. g., Tamil ellu (pronounced yellu [எள்ளு]). Sometimes, both words are suspected to derive from a common ancestor, e. g., Akkadian ellu flower, fruit, olive.          Olive flowers   Most of the con­tempo­rary Euro­pean lan­guages have a word for olive that derives, directly or in­directly, from Latin oliva. Ex­am­ples are German Olive, Polish oliwka, Slovenian oljka, Frisian oliif, Latvian olīvas and Dutch olijf. In some languages, the name got slightly modified, e. g., Lithuanian alyvos and Albanian ullir.  The medieval German terms for olive were Old High German oliberi (10.th century) and Middle High German ölber oil-berry, which were obviously formed under the influence of Latin oliva (Old High German oli oil is an old Romance loanword from Latin oleum and attested since the 8.th century). Modern German Olive is a much younger loan (16.th century). The Middle High German term has vanished from the language, but was conserved in Yiddish as eylbirt [אײלבירט], which, however, is today also used to denote other oilseed plans, e. g., sunflower.  Only in the languages of the Iberic peninsula, the Latin name was superseded by an Arabic loan: Spanish aceituna and Portuguese azeitona both come from Arabic az-zaytun [الزيتون] the olive; on the other hand, Spanish oliva and Portuguese oliveira refer to the tree, not to the fruit. See also capers for more examples of Arabic loans in Iberic languages.           Olive branch with unripe fruits           Very young olives, shortly after pollination   The Arabic word zaytun [زيتون] is cognate to Hebrew zayith [זית], Aramaic zayta [ܙܝܬܐ] and perhaps also Coptic jeeit [ϫⲉⲉⲓⲧ] olive and might derive from a Common Semitic root signifying to be prominent; on the other side, it might also have been borrowed from a language of Mesopotamia (Sumerian zirdum [𒍢𒅕𒌈], Akkadian serdu). Due to the spread of Islâm, the word was subsequently transferred to many more languages, from the Mediterranean (Portuguese azeitona) to Africa (Swahili zeituni) and Asia, which features related names in a wide area from the Caucasus to the South Asian tropics: Georgian zetis [ზეთის], Armenian jiteni [ձիթենի], Kazakh zäytun [зәйтун], Kurdish zaitun [زةیتوون], Farsi zeitun [زیتون], Punjabi and Hindi jaitun [ਜੈਤੂਨ, ज़ैतून], Tamil saidun [சைதூண்], Dhivehi zaithooni [ޒައިތޫނި] and even Mongolian chidun [чидун]. Another, more distantly related word is Maltese żebbuġ which is suspected to derive from a term for olive in the Berber language, which also belongs to the Semitic language subfamily.  Due to the enormous importance of olives for both the Greek and the Roman cultures, their name entered nearly every European language via Latin oleum oil as generic word for liquid fats, e. g., English oil, French huile, German Öl, Italian olio, Dutch olie, Polish olej and Finnish öljy.          Olive branch with unripe fruits   Similarly, the Iberic names for oil (Spanish aceite, Por­tuguese azeite besides óleo) derive from the local names of olive, aceituna and azeitona, respec­tively.  In other parts of the world, the generic names of cooking fats may also be derived from whatever oilseed dominates local cookery. Examples are provided by coconut and sesame.  Some Slavonic names of olive, e. g., Bulgarian maslina [маслина] olive, have an exactly opposite history: Maslina derives from maslo [масло] oil, fat, which originally meant butter (from a Common Slavonic root MAZ- spread). Words related to Bulgarian maslina made their way into some non-Slavonic languages, e. g., Romanian măslin and Yiddish masline [מאַסלינע].  The term maslo [масло], however, is not used for olive oil in Bulgarian, which is instead known as zehtin [зехтин] (from Turkish zeytin olive). Vegetable oils are often called olio [олио] in Bulgarian.  Occasionally, fruits of botanically unrelated trees may be called olives, often with an epithet referring to distribution. For example, the Bengali olives (or Indian olives) are the aromatic fruits of Elaeocarpus robustus; in West Bengal and Bangladesh, they are often used to prepare a chutney with delicious fruity and acidic taste. A similar case is the Thai olive ma kok [มะกอก] (Spondias mombin, Sp. pinnata, Sp. cytherea and others), which allegedly gave its name to Thailand’s capital, Bangkok. Such designations may sometimes be used to denote true Mediterranean olives in the local language, with or without an epithet foreign. "

Because it is well soluble in water, 2-phenyl­ethanol can be captured in aqueous distillates quite easily. (Indian Perfumer, 36, 93, 1992) Furthermore, monoterpenes have been found to contribute to the fragrance. The most important terpene in pandanus flowers is  terpinene-4-ol (up to 15%); furthermore,  α-terpineol, γ-terpinene and dipentene have been reported.           Pandanus tree with visible stilt root           Kewra Stem   The ripe fruits of P. tectorius owe their scent to an essential oil dominated by esters: Besides geranyl acetate, a couple of hemi­terpenoid esters were found: isopentenyl (3-methylbut-3-enyl)  and, to a lesser degree, dimethyl allyl (3-methylbut-2-enyl) acetates and cinnamates. (Phyto­chemistry, 43, 1277, 1996) Origin Various species of the genus Pandanus grow in tropical regions of Asia, Australia nad the Pacific; one of those has fragrant leaves used as spice.  The species that yields the fragrant kewra water is P. odoratis­simus, which grows in large number along the Indian East coast. It is also found, in lesser quantities, along the Indian West coast and Sri Lanka. Further inland, it becomes rarer, but scattered specimen grow all over the plains of the Eastern half of North India, including the lowland of Nepal (Terai).

    "etymology": "The term water pepper is motivated on one hand by the pungent peppery taste and on the other side by the plant’s natural habitat; analog formations are found in other European languages (German Wasser­pfeffer, French poivre d’eau, Serbian vodeni biber [водени бибер] or Russian perets vodyanoj [перец водыной]). Cf. also the English term marsh pepper and the Romanian name piper broaștei (piper broaştei) frog’s pepper.  The botanical species name, hydropiper, derives directly from the classical Greek plant name hydropeperi [ὑδροπέπερι], which appears in Dioskurides’ medical plant book (hydor [ὕδορ] water and peperi [πέπερι] pepper).  The word water has relatives in nearly every Indo–European language: Hittitee wātar [𒉿𒀀𒋫𒅈], Greek hydor [ὕδορ], Russian voda [вода] (vodka [водка] is a diminutive little water), Irish uisce (whisky is shortened from Gaelic uisge beatha water of life), Lithuanian  vanduo, Sanskrit uda [उद] water, furthermore Latin unda  wave. Another related English words  are otter and possibly aurochs. At these words’ basis lies a variable Proto-Indo–European root WED- with basic meaning wet, whence WODR̥ water is derived.           Water pepper   The Latin word for water, aqua, lives today in the Romance languages, e. g., in Italian acqua and French eau. In Germanic tongues, we have Gothic ahva, Old High German aha, Old English ea and Old Norse a  water, Modern German Au area around a river. Possibly related words are  found in other Western Indo–European tongues: Hittitee ekuzi he drinks and Tocharic yok- drink, which might all derive from Proto-Indo–European­pean AKʷĀ water.

    "origin": "Central Asia, probably Persia. Now cultivated in Western and Central Asia, Mediterranean countries and Northern India. In all that area, pomegranate trees are commonly found escaped into wilderness.           Split-open pomegranate fruit   Pomegranate is a very pop­ular fruit all over the Middle East. Though it can't be proven defi­nitely, the fruit of the Tree of Knowl­edge (ets ha-daat [עֵץ הַדַּעַת]) men­tioned in the biblical history of creation most probably was meant to be a pome­granate — though most West­erners would hardly believe it, it’s no­where said to be an apple! Rather, the Hebrew text uses pəri [פְּרִי], an un­specific term meaning just fruit. There is also a parallel in Greek mytho­logy, where the earth goddess Demeter [Δημήτηρ] lost her daughter Perse­phone [Περσεφόνη] to the underworld god Hades [ᾍδης] because of one single pomegranate grain the daughter had accepted.           Wild form of pomegranate on thorny shub            Almost mummyfied pomegranate (wild form)   The sweet cultivars of pome­granate are, thus, widely dis­tributed; the spice, however, is har­vested from small-fruited trees that are much closer to the wild form. Thy are grown in the Hima­layas, for example along the highway from Jammu to Srinagar in the Jammu & Kashmir state of India. The small trees or shubs bear long thorns and small fruits rarely exceeding 3 cm diameter; their seeds are very acidic and astringent. Those plants also yield herbal medicines and textile dyes. Etymology The name pomegranate is of ancient origin. In classical Latin, the fruit was known either as malum punicum or malum granatum (also melogranatum). In these names, malum means apple, granatum derives from granum grain and means (multi)grained (alluding to the many seed grains). The adjective punicus properly refers to Phoenicia in Asia Minor, but was in Latin more frequently used  with respect to Carthage, a Phoenician colony in Northern Africa (also Rome’s only source of Silphion); the Romans suspected pomegranate to be of African origin. The botanical genus name Punica is the feminine form of that adjective, as is appropriate for a fruit-bearing tree.           Pomegranate flower           Flowering pomegranate plant   Names of pome­granate in con­tem­porary West and Central Euro­pean tongues are adap­tations malum granatum, for example Italian melo­grano, which is a direct suc­cessor of the Latin term, or mil­groym [מילגרױם], a rare case of a Romance loan­word in Yiddish. In other lan­guages, the first part  usual­ly gets trans­lated: Examples are German Granat­apfel, Icelandic granat­epli or Finnish granaatti­omena. The English name pome­granate has a similar structure, but con­tains Latin  pomum fruit, apple (French pomme apple) instead of malum; the Old English term is cornappla grain-apple. In some languages, the apple-element is dropped completely, e. g., Ukrainian granat [ґранат] and Spanish granada.  In many European languages, the weapon shell has names similar to granate or grenade. These derive from the same Latin word granum grain: The reference is to the many fragments resulting from the detonation of a shell. Remarkably, also in Hebrew the word  rimon [רימון] may mean both pomegranate fruit and shell. The underlying Semitic root, RMM, means high, exalted and does not refer to grainyness. The plant name is also found in Arabic (ar-rumman [الرمان]) and Coptic (erman [ⲉⲣⲙⲁⲛ]), but without the secondary shell meaning.  The Farsi name anar [انار] already existed in Middle Persian; many language from Eastern Europe to the Indian Ocean have similar or identical names, which are probably direct or indirect Persian loans, e. g., Dhivehi annaaru [އަންނާރު], Punjabi and Kazakh anar [ਅਨਾਰ, анар], Armenian nur [նուր] and Turkish and Bulgarian nar [нар]. There might be a connection to ancient languages of Mesopotamia: Akkadian nurmû and Sumerian nur [𒉡𒌨] or nurma [𒉡𒌨𒈣]  Some of the Indian names of pomegranate contain an element sweet derived from the Proto-Indo–European root MEDʰU : Sanskrit madhubija [मधुबीज] and Tamil madulam [மாதுளம்].

    "note": "Several re­lated plants are more or less common orna­mentals both in Europe and in North­ern America. It is generally believed that members of genus Rhus are only mildly toxic or even mostly harm­less, for exam­ple the orna­mental tree stag­horn sumac (Rhus typhina). Never­theless, it should be borne in mind that the orna­mental varieties are not identical to the variety yielding the spice sumac, and that ingestion of those ornamentals may have adverse effects.           Danger: Japanese Laquer Tree,  Toxicodendron vernicifluum (urushi [ウルシ]), belongs to the group of poisonous sumacs           Allergenic: The fruits of poison ivy (T. radicans) are not to be touched           Sumac tree www.apinguela.com   The closely re­lated genus Toxico­dendron contains  a group of trees distributed over the New World and the Pacific Rim. As can be inferred from the genus name poisonous tree, these species are highly toxic.  They have formerly been listed under genus Rhus and are often referred to as sumac in common speach: Toxicodendron radicans (Poison Ivy), Toxicodendron diversilobum (Poison Oak), Toxicodendron vernix (Poison Sumac). All those contain urushiols (3-alkyl pyrocatechol derivatives with long side chains) that are extremely powerful allergenes: If applied to the intact skin they cause painful dermatitis in sensitive people. Sensitivity is acquired on previous contact to the urushiols, without any symptoms. The toxines are effective in sub-μg amounts. Lethal poisonings have been reported, particularly on ingestion or inhalation, which allows the urushiols to attack the mucous membranes of mouth, nose and intestines. Note that the fruits of Toxicodendron species are white to pale ochre, not red.  Allergenes of urushiol type (also alkyl resorcines) are commonly found in the Anacardiaceae family, e. g., in cashew shell oil or (in traces) unripe mangoes. See also pink pepper.

Main con­stituents The astrin­gent–acidic flavour of sumac spice mostly goes back to two different types of con­stituents: Tannines (gallo­tannines, together 4%) and organic acids (malic, citric, and tatric acid plus smaller amounts of  succinic, maleic, fumaric and ascorbic acid). Tannines are found in all parts of the plant, with par­ti­cu­lar­ly high con­cen­tra­tions in bark and root. These plant parts were, thus, used for tann­ing leather since anti­quity; more­over, they are part of anti-dia­rrhoeic con­coctions in folk med­icine.  Furthermore, the fruits contain traces of a volatile oil (0.02%) made up of aldehydes (2E-decenal, nonanal, 2E,4E-decadienal) and terpenoids (β-caryo­phyllene, α-pinene, α-terpineol, carvacrol and the diterpene hydro­carbon cembrene).

Rh. coriaria grows wild in Sicily, Western Asia and parts of Arabia and Central Asia. Etymology Sumac is of Semitic origin, deriving from a root  SMQ or ŚMQ to be red. In the Aramaic language, sumaqa [ܣܘܡܩܐ, ܣܡܩ] both designates the colour dark red and the sumac berries, while Modern Hebrew sumak [סומאק] means the spice exclusively. The name was transported to European languages via Arabic as-summaq [السماق] sumac.  The botanic genus name Rhus is a latinization of the plant’s Greek name, rhous [ῥοῦς], whose origin is not known to me. The species name coriarius refers to the usage of the plant for tanning (Latin corium leather). The German name Essigbaum vinegar tree (mostly used for Rh.  typhina, stag­horn sumac, an ornamental common in Europe) originally referred to Rh.  coriaria and is motivated by the sour taste of the berries. A similar idea stands behind Dutch zuurkruid sour condiment.  The scientific genus name Toxicodendron is a neo-Greek compound, whose second part (meaning tree) is discussed under juniper. The first element derives from classical Greek toxon [τόξον] bow, or rather the adjective toxikon [τοξικόν] of/for a bow, which was often used in the term toxikon pharmakon [τοξικὸν φάρμακον] poison for arrows (literally medicine for bows); for that reason, the stem tox- has aquired the meaning poison in modern scientific terminology (which does not follow classical habits here). The further origin of these words is not known for sure, but usually they are assumed to have been borrowed by Greek from an Iranian language, probably the tongue of the Scythians, famous horseriders and archers. Possibly, there is a distant and indirect kinship with Latin taxus yew, as yew-wood is one of the most popular materials for high-quality bows (cf. Beleg Strongbow).

Origin The sage varieties used as spice stem from the Mediterranean and Asia Minor. Sage is grown in Central Europe since the Middle Ages (see lovage).  Genus Salvia is not restricted to the Old World; several sage species from Central America are characterized by a sweet, fruity fragrance very dissimilar to Mediterranean sage, e. g. Pineapple sage (Salvia rutilans), peach sage (Salvia greggii),  fruit sage (Salvia dorisiana) and more.

The psychoactive constituents were identified as diterpenoid lactones (salvinorin A, divinorin C and others) specific for this species. S. divinorum  is the only hallucino­genic species in the whole Lamiaceae family. Etymology The names of sage in almost all European tongues derive from the classical Latin name of that plant, salvia. This name is thought to derive from  salvere save, thus indicating the medical value of the plant.

The only European language with independent names for sage is Greek. The Modern Greek term, alisfakia [αλισφακιά], can be related to a number of ancient names for not clearly identified sage species, e. g.  elelisphakos [ἐλελίσφακος]  used by Dioscurides, sphakos [σφάκος] used by Theophrastos and phaskoven [𐀞𐀒𐀸] found on Linear B tablets.

Usage may vary even within a given language, depending on the region and particularly on the local flora. In Jordan, zahtar usually means a spice mixture containing such herbs (see sumac for more).

    "sensory-quality": "Savory has a strong aromatic flavour, which could be compared to thyme (particularly, thyme harvested in summer), ajwain or the common strain of epazote.           Summer savory with flowers   In addition to this aroma, savory displays a certain pungent taste; of the spices listed before, only ajwain comes close. This pungency has led to savory being used as a (poor) substitute for black pepper, intended for those who have to avoid pepper for some medical reason. The perennial winter savory (Satureja montana) is more pungent than the common annual summer savory (S. hortensis). In any case, this pungency is mostly seen in the fresh (or dried) herb; by boiling, it is drastically reduced and vanishes quickly, so that the two varieties of savory become equivalent.  The species S. thymbra (thyme-leaved savory, pink savory), native from the Eastern Mediterranean to Iran, has a strong, very spicy flavour somewhere between common savory and thyme. I have seen it traded as zatar parsi, but I do not know which language that is supposed to be.  There is also a lemon-scented variety of winter savory (S. montana ssp. citriodora) from Slovenia whose flavour closely resembles lemon thyme. Only the African S. biflora has a true, spicy and very agreeable lemon odour; it is becoming increasingly popular with home gardeners, although it is a tropical plant and not very easy to grow. It can be used for sweet and savory food alike.           Lemon-scented winter savory           Lemon savory (sterile plant) © Sabine Amtsberg  ",
    "main-constituents": "Savory contains an essential oil in varying amounts; good quality should range between 1 and 2%. In contrast to the olfactorily similar thyme, savory contains only minor amounts of thymol, but the main component is carvacrol, a position isomer of thymol (30 to 45%).  Furthermore, p-cymene (max.  30%), γ-terpinene, α-pinene (8%), dipentene, borneol, 1-linalool, terpineol and 1-carvone are reported.  A related species, Satureja biflora, lemon savory from Africa, contains an essential oil dominated by citral (60%), furthermore camphor, menthone and pulegone. ",
    "origin": "Several species of the genus Satureja are found in the region around the Mediterranean Sea, although they probably stem from Western and Central Asia.  Besides S. hortensis (garden or summer savory), the perennial  S. montana  (mountain or winter savory, from the Apennine mountains) is traded in large scale. The flavour of these two species is almost indistinguishable, although the former is slightly more pungent. ",
    "etymology": "Many names in contemporary European tongues (Portuguese segurelha, Italian santoreggia, French sarriette, Czech and Slovak saturejka and also the regional German Saturei) as well as English savory go back to Latin satureia. The English name has been influenced by (but not derived from) the adjective savoury spicy: Middle English savery, from Latin sapor flavour via Old French sarree.  The origin of the Latin satureia is dark; postulated connections to satyr or saturn are most probably wrong, and also the derivation from saturare saturate can hardly convince.  I guess there is a common origin with Turkish sater, Hebrew zaʾatar [זעתר] and Arabic az-za'tar [الزعتر], which is a term used today in the Eastern Mediterranean to describe different aromatic herbs (mainly savory, thyme and marjoram) and also a spice mixture containing, among others, such herbs (see sumac).           Thyme-leaved savory flower           Thyme-leaved or pink savory, S. thymbra (flowering plant)   The Swedish name kyndel and the second element of Finnish kesäkynteli derive from Latin cunila, which is the adaptation of an obscure Greek plant name konile [κονίλη] which allegedly meant marjoram. The German name of creeping thyme (Thymus serpyllum), Quendel, has the same source; see also thyme.  The German term Bohnen­kraut bean’s herb indicates the value of savory  for bean dishes. Bohne bean and its Germanic cognates (Old Norse baun, Old English bēan, Dutch boon) originally referred to the Central Asian broad bean (Vicia faba); today, it is mostly used for the French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), which was introduced to Europe in the 16.th century from its native continent America. Despite numerous  cognates in non-Germanic languages (Latin faba bean, Greek phakos [φακός] lentil, Russian bob [боб] bean), the name cannot be explained sufficiently; yet the Proto-Indo–European root BʰEU swell, puff (cf. boil or German Beule swelling) is a likely  candidate, provided the name indeed is of Indo–European origin.  German Kraut has three different meanings: annual, non-woody plant, plant used for culinary or medical purposes and cabbage. The word occurs in German and  Dutch (kruid) only; Swedish krydd has the narrowed meaning spice, condiment. A Common Germanic form KRŪDA can be reconstructed, but non-Germanic examples are difficult to find, e. g., Greek bryein [βρύειν] sprout, germinate (cf. embryo) and Latin fruticari sprout (see chile). A possible Proto-Indo–European root accounting for both Kraut and bryein is GʷERU spit (cf. Latin veru lance); but it is doubtful whether the words in question are truly Indo–European.  Several European languages name savory as pepper herb, obviously in reference to the former use of savory as a substitute for black pepper. Examples are German Pfefferkraut, Estonian piparrohi, Polish pieprzyk, Hungarian borsfű and even Korean (huchu namu [후추나무]); the Hungarian name, however, may also mean cress. In French, there is a similar name poivrette little pepper, and Provençal has a rather colourful nickname for winter savory: pebré d’asé or pebre d’aï (in French more rarely  poivre d’âne) donkey pepper. Although savory is not efficient in the rôle of a pepper surrogate, it has been used a lot in Germany during and immediately after World War II, and some German cooks have kept this tradition until today. Sometimes, people substitute pepper by savory for alleged health reasons. "

    "main-constitu­ents": "Fresh vanilla beans con­tain vanillin gluco­side, an odour­less sub­stance. Only after har­vest, that glyco­side is broken by a labour-inten­sive fer­men­tation process, yielding the aromatic free vanillin (4-hydroxy 3-methoxy benz­aldehyde). The fermentation involves β-glucosidases.  The fully fermented fruit contains about 2% vanillin, depending on provenance (México 1.75%, Sri Lanka 1.5%, Indonesia 2.75%); in vanilla pods of exceptionally good quality, the crystallized vanillin may be visible on the surface in the form of tiny white needles (called givre, the French word for frost).           Guadeloupe-Vanilla, sterile plant   Besides vanillin (85% of total volatiles), other important aroma com­ponents are p-hydroxy benz­aldehyde  (up to 9%) and p-hydroxybenzyl methyl ether (1%). Besindes the teo aldehydes (vanillin, p-hydroxy benz­aldehyde), the corresponding alcohols and carbocyclic acids may also be present depnding on fermentation and storage details; the acids imply aroma loss because of their lower volatility.  A number of trace components (2-phenylethanol, various phenols, e.g., guajacol, p-cresol and creosol, and heterocyclic compounds of furane or pyranone structure) do significantly improve the flavour; about 130 more compounds have been identified in vanilla extract (phenoles, phenol ether, alcohols, carbonyl compounds, acids, esters, lactones, aliphatic and aromatic carbo­hydrates and hetero­cyclic compounds). Two stereo­isomeric viti­spiranes (2,10,10-trimethyl-1,6- and methylidene-1-oxaspiro(4,5)dec-7-ene), although only occurring in traces, also influence the aroma.          The flowers of Guadeloupe vanilla are particularly beautiful www.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de    Conventional wisdom has it that the quite dif­ferent fra­grance of Tahiti vanilla is due to vanilline (1.7%) and addi­tional con­tents of piperonal (heliotropin, 3,4-dioxy­methylen­benz­aldehyde) and diacetyl (butandione). This view, however, has been chal­lenged when an investi­gation of Tahiti vanilla beans from different sources found no piperonal, but only vanillin, anisyl alcohol, anisic acid and small amounts of both 3‑anis­aldehyde and the more common 4‑anisaldehyde. (Zeitschrift f. Lebensmitteluntersuchung und -forschung A, 199, 38, 1994)  Vanilla additionally contains 25% of sugars, 15% fat, 15 to 30% cellulose and 6% minerals. Water content is unusually high (35%).           Sterile Tahiti vanilla plant           The flowers of Guadeloupe vanilla are particularly beautiful www.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de  Origin South East México and Guate­mala. Today, the most im­por­tant ex­por­ters are Mada­gas­car and Ré­union (formerly called Bourbon), even before México; there is also some production in East Africa. In Asia, Indo­nesia is the most success­ful producer. Etymology The word vanilla derived from the Spanish name of the spice, vainilla, and is a diminutive of vaina sheath, vagina, pod (from Proto-Indo–European WAG hollow), perhaps motivated by the sheath-like shape of the fruit. The species name, planifolia, refers to the striking flat shape of the leaves.  The names of vanilla are almost identical in practically all languages of the world. Within Europe, there is little orthographic variation, e. g., Basque bainila, Polish wanilia and Latvian vaniļa. Examples from Asia include Arabic al-fanilya [الفانيليا], Farsi vanil [وانیل], Tamil vanikkodi [வனிக்கோடி], Indo­nesian panilli, Canto­nese wahn nei la [雲呢哪] and Man­darin fan ni lan  [梵尼蘭].  Quite interest­ingly, the native names of vanilla (e. g. Náhuatl tlilxochitl black flower) have, to my knowl­edge, not been trans­ferred to any other language after the conquest. Also, descriptive foreign-language names are almost completely missing, although designations in the spirit of aromatic bean would rather suggest themselves. Yet only Chinese has such names, for example xiang jia lan [香莢蘭] which I cautiously intrepret as orchid bearing fragrant beans.

    "origin": "South East México and Guate­mala. Today, the most im­por­tant ex­por­ters are Mada­gas­car and Ré­union (formerly called Bourbon), even before México; there is also some production in East Africa. In Asia, Indo­nesia is the most success­ful producer. ",
    "etymology": "The word vanilla derived from the Spanish name of the spice, vainilla, and is a diminutive of vaina sheath, vagina, pod (from Proto-Indo–European WAG hollow), perhaps motivated by the sheath-like shape of the fruit. The species name, planifolia, refers to the striking flat shape of the leaves.  The names of vanilla are almost identical in practically all languages of the world. Within Europe, there is little orthographic variation, e. g., Basque bainila, Polish wanilia and Latvian vaniļa. Examples from Asia include Arabic al-fanilya [الفانيليا], Farsi vanil [وانیل], Tamil vanikkodi [வனிக்கோடி], Indo­nesian panilli, Canto­nese wahn nei la [雲呢哪] and Man­darin fan ni lan  [梵尼蘭].  Quite interest­ingly, the native names of vanilla (e. g. Náhuatl tlilxochitl black flower) have, to my knowl­edge, not been trans­ferred to any other language after the conquest. Also, descriptive foreign-language names are almost completely missing, although designations in the spirit of aromatic bean would rather suggest themselves. Yet only Chinese has such names, for example xiang jia lan [香莢蘭] which I cautiously intrepret as orchid bearing fragrant beans.
